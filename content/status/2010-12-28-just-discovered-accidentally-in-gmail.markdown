Just discovered accidentally - In GMail chat, if you surround text with 2 underscores or  2 stars, they show up as italicized and bold text respectively in the chat. For example:  `_hello_` gets converted to _hello_ and `*world*` to **world**. If you discover more such hidden features of GMail, feel free to share here.
