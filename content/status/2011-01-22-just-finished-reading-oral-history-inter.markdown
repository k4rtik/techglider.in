Just finished reading [Oral history interview with Edsger W. Dijkstra](http://special.lib.umn.edu/cbi/oh/display.phtml?id=320) (transcript availabe on that link). This was suggested by Subhashree mam in our first lecture of Discrete Computational Structures course with her. An interesting read about Dijkstra's life and history of the establishment of computing science as a discipline.
