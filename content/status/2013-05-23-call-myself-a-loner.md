<p>Am I? I am so desperate to hang out with people, but can't find any I could relate to.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of things I ought to do this summer, and here I am am, lurking constantly on Gmail and FB in hope to start chat with some one, or just waiting for notifications.</p>
<p>What is this particular anxiety, desperation called?</p>
