title: Beginning of April

<p>… has been kinda unproductive. Turned the tables of productive vs distracting time on April 1 (that is the joke was on me). They say “the time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.” Indeed, I enjoyed the time after 7:45pm, when I went to a Pub Trivia Night for the first time, with people like me (read nerds). But I cannot account for the rest of the day which is the whole day!</p><p>I am going to serialize my tasks now, avoiding the urge to multitask with another until the first task is over. Let’s see how this goes.</p>
