And I successfully pulled out two consecutive all-nighters - a first time in my life! For the record: my first all nighter in college was just in last sem (during which Jaseem had to kick me 2-3 times to keep me awake). 

And these two were spent properly working on something I love and without facing any loss in productivity during the day. Congrats to myself!
