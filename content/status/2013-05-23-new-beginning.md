<p>It's been a very fake net life for me. Being on the internet, trying to represent myself as an open book but always careful not to post anything sensitive or hiding my true opinions; I have been so reserved all along.</p>
<p>This tumblr blog is anonymous, for I want to open up. Freely express myself, without fear, or social pressure.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's the right thing to do, talking about being open, anonymously, but it feels like a good start. Who knows, I might open up later in the true sense. :)</p>
