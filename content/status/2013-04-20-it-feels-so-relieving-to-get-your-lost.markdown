It feels so relieving to get your lost data back!

After trying multiple file recovery tools like TestDisk/PhotoRec, Recuva, etc. I had ran chkdsk (of course, from Windows) as a last resort on that particular partition last night. Since, Windows doesn't show protected system files easily I couldn't see the content of found.000 directory that got created in the said partition. I made a mental note of checking this directory out later from Linux.

As most of my mental notes go, I forgot about this as well. Just now accidentally visited that partition from Linux and browsed through the dir0000.chk directory inside, and voil√†, there it was - my complete home directory backup! :D
