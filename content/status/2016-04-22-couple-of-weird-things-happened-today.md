title: Couple of weird things happened today
---

<p>1. Early in the morning, I failed to recall the name of a girl I asked out on Valentine’s day just 3 years ago.<br>
2. Emailed Andy and got a thoughtful response back.<br>
3. Not the same with someone else I emailed.<br>
4. Felt so lonely at night that I decided to go out for a walk. Asked two people to join, one rejected, another didn’t see the text until I was back. The best part was meeting 3 explorers on the way and joining them for an adventure without second thought.</p>

<p>Life is surprises.</p>
