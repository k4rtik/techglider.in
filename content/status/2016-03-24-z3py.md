<p>So I finished the assignment on time, perhaps took much less time than I was expecting. Even though Z3 has a terrible documentation page. How hard could it be to browse its documentation? Curious, take a <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/z3.html">look</a>. Donâ€™t even get me started on the non-functional <a href="http://rise4fun.com/Z3Py/tutorial/guide">tutorial page</a>, what is that big blank white frame on the left!? I have tried multiple browsers and it stays the same.</p><p>Jack showed me what was wrong with that page:</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="799" data-orig-width="950"><img src="/images/z3py-screenshot.png" data-orig-height="799" data-orig-width="950"></figure><p>Well done, Microsoft.</p><p>EDIT: Because apparently Tumblr sucks with high-resolution pics (text screenshort in this case) let me paste the code for your enjoyment:</p><blockquote><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;var lang =<br>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;<br>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" &gt;</p></blockquote><p>And now I know that it sucks with showing snippets of code as well. :(</p>
