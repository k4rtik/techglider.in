Discovered today the only two subjects I am really liking in my 4th sem of BTech:
1. Data Structures and Algorithms - no attendance, low strength, more discussion possible in Sudeep Sir's class
2. Computer Organization - I think I was always more inclined towards hardware and internals of computer system, assembly language programming comes as a bonus part with this course
