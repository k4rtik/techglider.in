Hi all,
In this post I will be sharing some interesting points that fell along during realization of my idea of the TechGlider.First  of all I am sharing some initial hand-drawn logos for the site. These  were shared with my friend Arvis on June 28, 2009 for his comments.

The following is a screenshot of StudenTech.com -  a website I created while I was in class XI. I guess that was my first  proper website in which I tried to share my knowledge. Initial versions  of TechGlider.com were adapted to this site until I decided not to carry  it forward:
