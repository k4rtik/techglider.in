Today I am relaunching my website -- techglider.in in a new avatar. This in the form of techglider.com used to be my first website until the domain was stolen by a domain shark (insert link to the post). In between I stopped maintaining and went over to k4rtik.wordpress.com for my blogging needs. Even that has not seen any new content in a long time.

A constant feeling of not having a web home and a place to put my thoughts out for the world has been nagging me for months, this reinit is the first step in solving this problem.
