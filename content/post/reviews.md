After moving to ~~Bangalore~~ Bengaluru over [a year ago](/post/2013/07/21/week-1-at-bangalore-and-work/) and starting to work full time, I was beginning to think I had lost touch with writing on my blog completely. This week after stumbling upon a fellow [BBC](http://www.meetup.com/bookclubonline/) member's [book blog](http://thebooketerian.blogspot.in/), it occurred to me --- I actually had been writing book reviews on Goodreads all this while!

In the spirit of keeping all my written (and hopefully useful) content here, I decided to migrate the read-worthy reviews here. Anyhow, who knows what happens when one fine day Goodreads disappears from the web (this is a concern with any third-party web service).

All the available book reviews can be accessed with the [reviews](/tags/reviews/) tag.
