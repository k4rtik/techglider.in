This post will be short.

After spending more than 4 months here at NIT Calicut, I am finally going back home.

This period starting from AIEEE 2009 counseling in July has been an amazing roller coaster ride for me. Many wonderful things happened with me. I got admission to a college whose image I had always seen in my dreams. That too in the same branch, i.e. Computer Science & Engineering, except for which I knew I could never excel in any other engineering branch. Now, after completing one semester here, all this still seems like a dream. Maybe I need more time to start getting to the reality of things.

This period has been eventful - more eventful than any other period of my life as is clear from my previous posts. I have met a lot of amazing people, made new friends, gone through hilarious experiences, accepted a lot of truths and rejected many lies; all of this in this _short_ period of time. Even then, it feels like, it was just yesterday, when I was in a taxi with my father, Arvis and his father entering the lanes of NIT Calicut amid the beauty of the God's Own Country coming from about 2,800 KMs away. Well, that was July 21.

There is a lot to say, lot more to tell, many delightful and _not-so-delightful_ moments to share. I hope I will continue to write from home.

At the end of Semester I, I hope, there is a lot more to come. While I write this, these are the lines that come to my mind from a great poem: _Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening_, by _Robert Frost:_


> The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.


And yeah, I will be back by 19th or may be even earlier, back to my _Dream College_ (this is for you, Arvis ;) ), and I love this place.
