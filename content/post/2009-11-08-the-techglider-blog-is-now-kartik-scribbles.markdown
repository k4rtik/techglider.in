This change is something I wanted to incorporate since I [restored this blog](/post/2009/10/03/the-techglider-blog-is-back/) in the beginning of last month. Finally, the change is here.

The main reason why I changed the name of the blog is simple. 'The TechGlider Blog' sounds like the official blog of my site - [TechGlider.com](http://techglider.in) which, in its actuality, is not that. This is my blog, Kartik's. So, the name _Kartik Scribbles..._

More personalized, more sensible, more fun, more readable. This change will give this blog a new dimension.

**Another news:** I now have a [Blogger profile](http://www.blogger.com/profile/08714351862062860001) and a [blog](http://kartiksinghal.blogspot.com/) too, which without any surprises redirects you to here, on Kartik Scribbles... This was required to remain connected with a lot of bloggers who prefer using Blogspot and I can now follow their blogs and make friends via Google Friend Connect.

-Kartik

**EDIT (2011-03-13):** The name has been reverted back to The TechGlider Blog, see [this post](/post/2011/03/13/and-we-are-back/) to know why. And for no particular reason, I have removed Google Friend Connect support too (at least for now).
