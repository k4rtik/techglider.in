[![Business Doctors: Management Consulting Gone Wild](https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1395587251m/21532628.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21532628-business-doctors)[Business Doctors: Management Consulting Gone Wild](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21532628-business-doctors) by [Sameer Kamat](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5894826.Sameer_Kamat)

My rating: [3 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1029933223)

I don't generally pick up fiction books that easily, but when I first read about the book, I [found it intriguing](https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1769285-feedback-on-business-doctors-book-page#comment_96247221). The fact that the book is self-published added to my curiosity.

So, when Sameer approached me over Goodreads and offered a complimentary copy in exchange of an honest review, I was all but happy.

The plot immediately catches your attention in that it puts a consultant into a completely unimaginable situation and explores how he handles the situation to the best of his capability. Lots of management related clich√©s are used, sometimes just to add to humor, sometimes just being true to the identity of the protagonist; reminded me of meetings from top management at work.

Being self-published, lack of editing shows up here and there but doesn't really detract the reader from the fast pace of the plot. A worthy read in that flight journey or during a free weekend. Overall, I enjoyed the book and it met my expectations.

In summary, a very fast-paced and interesting read from a first time fiction-writer.
