From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist,_the_Movie):


> Zeitgeist,  the Movie is a 2007 documentary film, produced by Peter Joseph about  the Jesus myth hypothesis, the attacks of `9/11`, and the Federal Reserve  Bank as well as a number of conspiracy theories related to those three  main topics. It was released free online via Google Video in June 2007. A  remastered version was presented as a global premiere on November 10,  2007 at the 4th Annual Artivist Film Festival & Artivist Awards. The  film has attracted significant public interest.


I just happened to watch this movie, and was truly shocked :O to learn the secrets behind the religion, the `9/11` attacks and about how power dominates. Watch this movie for free at its official website:
