Just spotted this on the _unofficial_ Notice Board of Hostel A (my hostel at NIT Calicut). Please click on the pics to enlarge:

This left me wondering of the creative minds of my hostel mates. And yeah, if you find his specs, please return them. You can post a comment here and ask me to help you return the glasses ;).

Another one taken on November 4 on Robin's birthday:

You may be wondering what is **_GPL_**?

GPL (G*** Pe Laat) is a tradition in NITC to celebrate birthdays of guys particularly popular among Northys (North Indian students), but sometimes Mallus (NITC lingo for Malayalis (Keralites)) are also happy to join in. Although, I don't like this tradition much, but it's fun to watch.

OK now, I have to hurry back to the hostel. End Sems start on 19th. Have to study a lot.
