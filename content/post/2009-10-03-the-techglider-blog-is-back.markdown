I am really happy to announce that I have been able to restore the TGB successfully (after fiddling with the backups for almost a month). This period of two and a half months without my blog was really unbearable for me; the only thing that helped me bear this pain was what was happening in my real life. A lot of wonderful events have changed my life (e.g. I have taken admission in BTech CSE at NIT Calicut).

So, there is going to be a lot of activity on TGB in a few days.

**One important news:** TGB has moved from its previous address [www.techglider.in/blog](http://www.techglider.in/blog) to [www.techglider.in/kartik/blog](http://www.techglider.in/kartik/blog). So, please update your bookmarks, although the previous links will be working as usual (thanks to some nice redirection settings).

**Second important news:** TGB will get a complete makeover as I have decided to make this my personal blog instead of The TechGlider (official) Blog (as if it wasn't personal previously ;) ). This is the only reason why its URL has also changed to include my name.

OK gotta hurry, exams start on Wednesday and I haven't started studying yet.
See ya,

-Kartik
