i[![Steve Jobs](https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327861368m/11084145.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs)[Steve Jobs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs) by [Walter Isaacson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7111.Walter_Isaacson)

My rating: [5 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/266974042)

In my opinion a biography of Jobs can't be better than this - so impartial, detailed and so well researched.

You not only get to learn about a man who perfected convergence of art and technology and changed the way people interact with tech, but also what Apple is about, its ethos and how it was built.

Visiting book stores these days you will found a whole shelf of Steve Jobs biographies, my advice, don't worry about the cost and buy this one!
