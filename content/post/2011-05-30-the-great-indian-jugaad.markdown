Just spotted this unique and innovative use of cheap UPS batteries in the local vegetable market (_sabzi mandi_) near my home at Ghaziabad. I could see dozens of these lamps in a row in the market. At a place like ours with such severe power cuts, this seems like a good alternative for the vegetable vendors.
