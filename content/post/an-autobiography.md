My rating: [5 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/298129868)

Recommended read to understand what Mahatma Gandhi and his ideals of Truth and Ahimsa stood for, in his own words.

Gandhi does full justice with the autobiography not failing to mention incidences from his life which could be termed as objectionable, or embarrassing. His exploration of dietetics, religion, dressing styles and later politics reaffirms my belief in a statement one of my professors made about Gandhi which inspired me to read the book:

> "Gandhi was the only one among so many famous figures who tried to follow his ideals while living within the society."

There were many who left their families, houses, society, etc. responsibilities to discover themselves and to teach the world, but that was an easy path. Real difficulty is in living by your ideals while being in the society.
