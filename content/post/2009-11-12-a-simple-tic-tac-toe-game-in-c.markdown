Tic Tac Toe (T3), a two-player game developed in C/C++ in 2006-2007

For the school project in C++ in standard 11, I chose to make a game. Although the game doesn't        feature AI, it demonstrates the graphics and sound capabilities of C/C++ with Turbo C++ compiler.

Here is the link to the code (I can't support it any more, so please don't ask if you are unable to run it.):
