I started out with Posterous [6 months back](http://kartikscribbles.posterous.com/my-first-posterous-blog-post-67) mainly to just try it out. After inactivity for about 3 months, I started posting regularly here. I have tried different kinds of posts in this period - with photos, code listings, even [other type of attachments](http://kartikscribbles.posterous.com/latex-project-report-template). But after my last post I was rather disappointed with Posterous and decided to move on to some other blogging platform. So, this is the last post here and I want to present my observations. likes and dislikes about Posterous.




**Likes:**






  * Ability to post via email, though I discovered even WordPress can do that but it gives you a rather cryptic sendto address.


  * Import feature to import your posts from a previous blog, many platforms are supported. (Again a standard feature on WordPress and many other blogging platforms).


  * The Gallery feature - when you attach photos with the post email, they appear as a nice enough photo gallery at the beginning of your post.


  * Scribd support - when you attach a pdf to your post it shows up in your blog as a cool embedded document powered by Scribd (though it still requires Flash support).


  * Those cool drop downs for About, Tags and Search at the top powered by [M8 theme](http://m82.posterous.com/) I am using.




**Dislikes:**






  * It doesn't produce decent (X)HTML automatically for a post sent through mail.


  * Same goes for code listings, there is no way that I know to tell posterous what I am posting through email is a part of code and should come between a `<code>` tag pair. And appending `<code>` tag pair for each in line command within normal text is a pain if done manually.


  * The web interface and toolbar is also quite basic and features very less functionality.


  * In my [last post](http://kartikscribbles.posterous.com/latex-project-report-template) I had to attach a tar.gz archive containing some LaTeX source files. I was happy to see it appeared on the blog with a nice icon and friendly "Click here to download" link. But I discovered there was no way I could update that file (or upload another one instead) as the web interface doesn't allow that type of file. I wondered why does it accept the same file through email posting though.




Due to my complicated blogging requirements, now I have shifted to WordPress (my favorite) again, though, this time on [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/) instead of my own domain. You can visit the new blog at [http://k4rtik.wordpress.com](http://k4rtik.wordpress.com) and all my previous posts are available there as well.




_My concluding remarks for Posterous:_   
Posterous is a good service for basic blogging but they have a long way to go to compete with solutions like WordPress or Blogger. At its current state, I feel it's immature for my blogging needs.
