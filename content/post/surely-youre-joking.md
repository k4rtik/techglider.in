Feynman](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1429989.Richard_P_Feynman)

My rating: [5 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/220270958)

This is one of those books which bring a turning point in your life, and make you reevaluate it, much like Randy Pausch's The Last Lecture and Steve Jobs bio for me. Made me take interest in physics around us again. :)

Feynman was surely a man of multiple lives, how could anybody live so much? Physicist, safe cracker, artist, frigideira (an instrument used in Samba music) player, nobel prize laureate, drummer, and more. His mischievous nature and varied interests (exploration of hypnotism and sense deprivation, e.g.) were inspiring in a way.

As a scientist, he leaves out important messages primarily in the chapters: O Americano, Outra Vez! (later part, pg. 211 onwards, about state of science education in Brazil at the time); Is Electricity Fire? (on Jewish (dis)interest in science); Judging Books by their Covers (review of school math books, and disappointment obtained from them); and lastly, Cargo Cult Science, the last chapter.

A must read for any science-loving person.
