Abdul Kalam](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/986042.A_P_J_Abdul_Kalam)

My rating: [4 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/577445550)

A good book that shows the life of a President that India loved, sheds light on the decisions he made that were considered controversial and inspires the leader in one. Not a book for a casual reader, for sure, they might complain it's boring.

I feel Kalam uplifted the position of President of India with his initiatives during his tenure. Something that is a challenge to meet for any of the later presidents.

One reason I could easily read this book was because Kalam has been an inspiration to me through his two earlier books - Ignited Minds and Wings of Fire, and this being a sequel to Wings, I could easily connect the dots.
