[![A Byte of Vim](https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1321536329m/12721576.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12721576-a-byte-of-vim)[A Byte of Vim](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12721576-a-byte-of-vim) by [Swaroop C.H.](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3041247.Swaroop_C_H_)

My rating: [4 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/601681823)

Finished that 30-minute crash course with vimtutor and don't yet know the power of vim?

This small book is your next best step to become an effective vimmer.

One star less only because the book is out of maintenance and one may find many broken links. Also, the formatting of the definitive source (PDF) could be a bit better.
