On older connections (before december 2007) broadband usage check can be done on one of the following IP addresses:



	
  * [http://10.240.64.195](http://10.240.64.195/)

	
  * [http://10.240.89.199](http://10.240.89.199/)

	
  * [http://10.240.128.195](http://10.240.128.195/)

	
  * [http://10.240.16.195](http://10.240.16.195/)

	
  * [http://10.240.144.195](http://10.240.144.195/)


If  one address doesn't work, you can try another one. I happened to use  the 4th IP address for a lot of months and one day it stopped working;  now I am using the 2nd IP address from the above list.
