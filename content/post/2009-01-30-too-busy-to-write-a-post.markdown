It's been a lot of time (53 days, to be exact) since I last wrote.

But it's how it is, I have been busy and I am busy with studies atleast for another 3 months. And I am happy about it.

A lot has happened in between - that includes my leaving the room at Kalu Sarai (and start of the "[then usual](http://www.techglider.in/blog/2008/08/05/that-hard-and-tiring-day-of-july-31/)" up-downs from home to IIT Gate for classes); a lot of AITS tests which went bad as compared to my standards, leaving me bewildered at my scores; and some blows on my face that got me right on track.

Well, there's nothing exciting except studies that's going on with life now, so, won't be writing more than this.

Good Bye. _Hope to write another post in Feb..._
