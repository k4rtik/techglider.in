I am happy :-) to inform all of you that I have finally designed a logo for the TechGlider:

![The TechGlider Logo](http://www.techglider.in/kartik/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/tglogo.png)

Although I am not that satisfied with the logo, but I think it will do for the time being. Any suggestions for improvement of the logo are welcome.

I couldn't finish the development of TechGlider this week (designing a logo really takes too much of time ;-)
