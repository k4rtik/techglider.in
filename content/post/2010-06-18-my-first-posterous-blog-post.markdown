Now this seems quite interesting. I had been noticing posterous here and there for a lot of time but never cared to look what it is about. But just now I followed the link in an RT posted by Atul Chitnis on twitter that led me to learn the concept behind this service. The link was:




  
**I laughed at Posterous, but they proved me wrong** - [http://blog.dustincurtis.com/i-dont-laugh-at-startup-ideas-anymore](http://blog.dustincurtis.com/i-dont-laugh-at-startup-ideas-anymore)

Got some lesson to learn from the story of posterous. If you have some idea you can start working on it, without wasting time on making it more and more feature-filled. Start with small things, get them active and then start adding more and more features.

Let's see whether I like it more than my regular WordPress blog at [http://techglider.com/kartik/blog](http://techglider.com/kartik/blog)
