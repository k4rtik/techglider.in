My friend Amit had just created an account on GMail and logged out after that. Just then, he opened Google and was going to search something when I mentioned I'm Feeling Lucky to him. He asked what is that to which I thought of replying by showing him the official explanation by Google, so I clicked on 'the' button without any search string. And voila! It showed this:

After scratching my head for few seconds, it occurred to me that it could be the countdown to welcome the new year 2010. I fired up the calculator and divided the seconds by 60 two times. And, yeah, I was correct, it showed 8 point something - the number of hours remaining till midnight.

Just wanted to share this with all of you, after all, I have not posted anything this December.

At the end of my last post this year:

I wish you a grand _**Happy New Year, 2010**_.

**EDIT** (January 1, 2009):

If you try clicking on I'm Feeling Lucky button, now, it shows some wonderful 'Happy New Year' fireworks.
