V.](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7115180.Haris_Ibrahim_K_V_)

My rating: [3 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/914619303)

A first collection of stories & articles from a budding writer friend. Liked the book overall.

The stories are imaginative and much often leave one thinking near the end. Some articles felt lacking in trying to convey the intended meaning, but others especially void Easy(); and The Magic of Reading were quite well written.

Looking forward to a full length book from the author.
