It's been so long - missing the TechGlider - my dream, my hard work of over 2 years was gone. [Started in July 2008](/post/2008/07/31/finally-a-website-of-my-own/), gone in July 2010. :(


## The reason of this long absence:


I lost the ownership of the domain techglider.com - partly because of my own carelessness, and partly because of my webhost [Four 'S' Tech](http://fourstech.in)'s troubles. In the process, I did learn a few interesting things like the concept of drop catching, how the companies like GoDaddy make so much money; and more importantly how not to lose my domain again. But now we're back with a new domain [TechGlider.in](http://techglider.in) which is better in a sense as it gives an Indian touch.


## What has changed over this period:





	
  * Having no other choice and bound by my love for blogging, I started writing first on [Posterous](http://kartikscribbles.posterous.com/) and then on WordPress.com. The blog at WordPress.com - [Kartik Scribbles...](http://k4rtik.wordpress.com/) - is the place where you can find all my recent posts (and status updates).

	
  * [The TechGlider Forums](http://techglider.in/forums) has lost all its shine (whatever small it used to have) - it needs to be made active again. It was the best place IMHO to put all those nifty tricks and commands I used to discover while working or hacking on computers and could refer them again easily. I welcome you to join it too.

	
  * The main site [techglider.in](http://techglider.in) has become outdated and needs a makeover including [my homepage](http://techglider.in/kartik) on that. I have many more cooler projects to share (show off!) and talk about which I have done over last 2 years.




## What's new on this blog:





	
  * As you can see the new theme - _[Audacity of Tanish](http://code.ahren.org/tanish-wp)_ by [Ravi Sarma](http://code.ahren.org/) which is completely different in terms of colors or concept. I liked this alternative design the first time I saw it. I want to mention I have used another theme by the same author - [Ahimsa](http://code.ahren.org/ahimsa) - for quite a lot of time, and I particularly like his themes. If I have to describe his themes in a single word - they are **DIFFERENT** - they stand apart. Thanks [@ahrencode](https://twitter.com/ahrencode) for these wonderful themes.

	
  * The name is again being changed back to The TechGlider Blog to keep away from the confusion. So, from now on, TGB is this blog and [Kartik Scribbles...](http://k4rtik.wordpress.com) is my Wordpress.com blog.

	
  * And _nothing more. _I will be using my [WordPress.com blog](http://k4rtik.wordpress.com) for newer posts until I decide how to handle this double-blog situation. Another reason for this is I like the P2 theme I am using there a lot for it's alternate posting options. I tried switching to that theme here but apparently my previous posts are not being converted properly. Let's see if I can figure out a solution when I get some free time.


I would love to hear from you - those who have  been users of TechGlider (forums, blog, anything), those who used to like it (or hate it), those who just spotted it now (and want to say Hi! ;)) and those who have any suggestions. Until next time,

_Ciao_

Kartik
