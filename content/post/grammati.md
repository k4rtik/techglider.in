title: 100 Days of Grammati

[Haris](https://sosaysharis.wordpress.com/) had posted the following tweet few months ago:

After quickly checking out grammati.com, I had signed up. Received the following email this morning (for some reason Google decided to mark this as spam for the first time) and I thought it was time to spread the word:

Basically, the nifty little service sends you a daily mail, such as above, and asks you to answer 5 simple grammar questions. In my 100 days of usage, I have come to love the service and find it a great way to remain a _grammar nazi_ (quick apology to friends whom I have annoyed time and again). Specifically, I found I could easily unlearn some of my frequent grammatical mistakes and learn subtle difference in usage of phrases with similar meaning like _in case_ vs _if_.

This is quite an effortless habit to form as it takes less than a few minutes of time and there is no chance you can miss it (if you check your email regularly). Highly recommended, go sign up at [Grammati.com](http://grammati.com).

Aware of any other such services, feel free to leave a note in the comments.
