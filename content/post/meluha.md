My rating: [4 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/662449865)

Fast paced and interesting. I don't think I have read any mythological fiction before and this as a first wasn't a bad start. Hope to finish the trilogy in next few months.

I recall the craze about Shiva trilogy while in college, especially among the folks at LH ;). Written using very simple words, the book re-imagines Shiva as a man and describes his journey in the strange and unfamiliar world of Meluha and beyond. The revelation near the end is an eye opener and makes one think about the fine balance necessary between a disciplined culture and individual freedom.

Liked the fact that the author has the etymological information handy for most of the Hindi words used in the content.
