Though not that far away, but it's finally here. I will be living in some other place for the first time ever in my life. I want to admit, if I had not dropped the year, this may have happened more than a month ago (moving into hostel of some great college, I would have taken admission into).

So, what has happened is that due to LARGE commuting time for attending classes at FIITJEE (5 hours commute time for a 4 hour session), I have been forced to take up a room at Delhi and reside there.

This means I am going to miss my family, my home and most of all my obsession, my PlatiniumV2 (for those who don't know, it's the name of my PC) :-(. I have never been away from my PC for this long stretch of time. And, I won't be able to post here at the TechGlider Blog for weeks at a stretch :-(. I am leaving a lot of unfinished work behind and understand that it's gonna be a tough ride ahead, managing & developing TechGlider.com and preparing for IIT JEE - 2009.

I want to listen from you guys, about my work and my writing, you find it good or bad? Particularly, checkout [the main TechGlider site](http://www.techglider.in/index.html) and [the TechGlider Forums](http://forums.techglider.in/) and tell me how do you feel about them.

Will be leaving tomorrow morning. Hope to meet you again at the weekend.
