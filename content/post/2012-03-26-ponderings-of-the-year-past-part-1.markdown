It's been long since I wrote something. To be frank, it was last July in which I actually [spoke out my mind](http://k4rtik.wordpress.com/2011/07/15/of-corruption-india-and-my-first-bribe/). Of course, I wished to write a lot more (who doesn't). This one is going to be long, so I decided to partition it.

The following are few important lessons I learnt over the gone year - 2011:


## Computer Science != Computer Engineering


Vineeth Sir always calls it _[Computing Science](http://people.cse.nitc.ac.in/vpaleri/presentations/computing-science-discipline)_, we even had a discussion over it, perhaps over a year back( and once again recently); the doubt got cleared up only after I looked up [ACM's Computing Curricula Recommendations](http://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations) which defines five sub-disciplines of computing: **Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Systems, Information Technology,** and **Software Engineering **(they have pretty decent comparisons among these disciplines using pictures and charts). The story didn't end there though, I was yet to realize what repercussions this seemingly subtle difference had in store for me.  Some people like Nandu (had an hour-long discussion with him months back) would call it the Department's shortcoming that it is too focused on the Science part of the field, which leads to lesser interest in technology among students and hence, lack of quality of academic (or otherwise) projects. Anyhow, for me this was the year of actually realizing this difference - with low scores and finding lesser interest in some of the core theory subjects including Data Structures and Algorithms (not all though - I loved Discrete Computational Structures and managed to secure an 'S'). Perhaps I always wanted to be a Computer Engineer! I was always the tech-geek with basic know-how of (almost) everything, mostly counting on my experience, trying to help others and having the fondness for cryptic syntax, etc; but over time it dawned on me that that's not all - theory subjects tend to be more intellectually inclined (or research-focused if you may), and as Murali Sir frequently points out - it should be a matter of choice and not inability to prefer systems over theory in CS. Perhaps the most important thing that I missed to do was [reading](http://k4rtik.wordpress.com/2010/12/25/this-is-the-last-lecture-i-am-giving-you/) owing to over-confidence and a fuzzy image of self.



Lot more to say. Part 2 coming out soon.
