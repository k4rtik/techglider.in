You may have noticed I have written almost nothing after November last year.

The main reason has been some or other problem with my website's hosting server until it was shifted to another one in early Feb. But after this happened it's some strange problem in the campus network that my website is only accessible at certain unexpected times as now. While writing this I am not sure, I will be able to publish this post or not, as the site seems accessible at completely random times and duration.

Anyway, you can follow most of the updates from me on Twitter: [twitter.com/k4rtik](http://twitter.com/k4rtik)

My reason of worry is:


> I wan't to write about so many things - S2, FOSSMeet, gang of geeks, Atul Chitnis, LAN at A, LaTeX, @[sengupta](http://twitter.com/sengupta), engg. gfx, seniors, ... When?


The above quote was my [Twitter post](http://twitter.com/k4rtik/statuses/11093644655) about 18 hours ago. And [the following](http://twitter.com/k4rtik/status/11093507431) a little before the above:


> I am completely furious when I am unable to express myself - my blog doesn't open inside the NITC campus. What the hack??
