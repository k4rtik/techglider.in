I am glad to inform you that finally the [The TechGlider Forums](http://forums.techglider.in/) have been activated on techglider.in. :-)

To visit the forums you can go to [http://forums.techglider.in](http://forums.techglider.in/). Please read the first topic "General Rules" before posting anything on the forums.

You can register yourself on the forums by clicking on the "Register" link at the top-right of the page. After you become a member, you can ask questions, get answers, start new topics for discussions under the given categories and post about anything you like.

There is a facility of groups in the forums where the members can form their own groups with common features such as if they belong to same school or work on a common language like C++.

The most active users will be allowed to become the moderators with whose powers they can modify, or delete the topics or posts.
