Today, it's 3 years since the day I opened my Gmail account.

I remember those days when Gmail was in beta (although it's still in beta as the Gmail logo says) and signup for a Gmail account was only by invitation. It was like a privilege to have a Gmail account B). Then, came an invitation from my cousin and I became a proud owner of my Gmail account.

Gmail gave me a lot of things I always desired from using the e-mail:



	
  * It gave me my own identity on the web by providing me an email with my own full name and not those with silly prefixes/suffixes such as cool, sweet, or those including your birth date or year or using lastname before firstname or using . (dot) or _ (underscore in between).

	
  * Then, it provided freedom from those irritating (visual and blinking) ads that are displayed on other mail services like Yahoo! Mail, Indiatimes, Hotmail or Rediffmail.

	
  * It features a really simple interface that doesn't need any explanations.

	
  * Its organizational features (read: labels and filters) helped me in organizing all mail easily as the labels just separate out different groups of mail with different colors.

	
  * Its spam protection is world class, provided, for some newer spam you have to report Gmail on its first occurrence by clicking on the "This is Spam" button.

	
  * One of the best things I found with Gmail was that you don't have to delete any of the mail (except for spam) you receive. With _over 7035 MBs of disk space (and counting)_, it provides just too much space that regular mails can merely exceed 5% of the total. On my own account, I have just filled up 165 MB (2%) in 3 years. And I can go back and view any of the 3538 mails I received since August 16, 2005.

	
  * It comes with other features that made my life easier like keyboard shortcuts and in-browser chat and is regularly adding more features.


I would seriously recommend a Gmail account for every netizen who wants to utilize the net for a more organized life for all the features that come with it and that too for free.
