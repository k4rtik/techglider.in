I will no longer maintain this page, as I have found a much better way to keep track of the books I read - Goodreads.com. My list here - [http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6520743-kartik-singhal?order=d&shelf=read&sort=date_read](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6520743-kartik-singhal?order=d&shelf=read&sort=date_read)

**Last edited:** October 26, 2011, edited 11 times in total.


**Reason:** _Updated about my new books page on Goodreads.com._
