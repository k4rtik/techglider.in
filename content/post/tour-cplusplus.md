title: Reading A Tour of C++
---

I have been reading Bjarne Stroustrup’s [A Tour of
C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html) and the language feels like a totally
new language since [my last project in
C++](http://techglider.in/post/2009/11/08/my-old-projects/) which was years ago.
Since, (re-)learning a language requires both reading and writing code, I
decided to work through some exercises on [Exercism](http://exercism.io/).

For C++, Exercism encourages a test-driven approach to solving problems and
requires some tooling support ([CMake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake)) to
focus on solving the problem instead of wasting time on setting up a build
system for each exercise. I wasn’t familiar with either.

For both test-driven development (TDD) basics and familiarizing myself with
CMake, I found working through (typing out the code from) the slides of
[Test-Driven Development in
C++](https://github.com/boostcon/cppnow_presentations_2014/tree/master/files/test_driven)
by [Richard Thomson](https://user.xmission.com/~legalize/) very useful. In fact,
it looks like Richard is the one behind the C++ track of Exercism, according to
the description of a [recent CppCast
episode](http://cppcast.com/2015/06/richard-thomson/). It took me a couple of
hours yesterday and coding C++ in a modern text editor like
[Atom](https://atom.io/) was joyful (though it will take time for its packages
[to mature](https://github.com/LiquidHelium/atom-clang-format/issues/34)). I am
yet to squash some remaining bugs and make all tests pass before my first
submission on Exercism.

If one is looking to quickly brush up on C++, I find this combination of quickly
learning the most important language features through a K&R style book and
working through some exercises pretty efficient. YMMY.
