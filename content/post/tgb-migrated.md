Just a quick note that I have successfully migrated all posts from the original TechGlider Blog which used to reside at http://techglider.in/kartik/blog couple of years ago.

This completes migration of all my written content. Fixing broken links, images, etc. is the major work that remains.

Aside: 

- I ended up skimming through much of my old content, feels very childish now; my friends from that time might get a laugh or two reading about memories recorded in here.
- Also ended up browsing and uploading my first complete website work from 2004 (gosh, it's been 10 years!). See the 'Browse here' link at [my old projects](/post/2009/11/08/my-old-projects/).
