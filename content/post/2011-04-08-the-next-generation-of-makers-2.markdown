I know the future is what I make it.

I believe I can make the world better.

I understand I need knowledge and passion.

I choose to participate, not observe.



I work with my hands and my mind.

I pursue beauty in what I produce.

I see art in science and science in art.

I value skills.



I am the next generation of Maker!
