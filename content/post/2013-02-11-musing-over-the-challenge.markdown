It's been 10 days since I started [this challenge](http://k4rtik.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/28-days-challenge/). Up to now, I seem to be failing in living up to the daily requirement in the [Fibonacci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci) order (0, 1, 1, 2 - the day gaps); of course, I don't want the sequence to continue.

In retrospect, I can see what stopped me in the days I missed - once it was just a tiring day, someday it was work/extended meeting, some day just plain lack of creativity. And then, there is the _fear of mediocrity -_ uncertainty over the quality of content that I can generate on a daily basis ([Do read up  on Oatmeal's view on this](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/making_things)).

I have come to believe that perhaps the writing challenge I have undertaken is not so important as the quality of content I post. Sharing a quote, or a few photographs do not seem enough to just live up to the daily task. A fairly decent write-up takes anywhere between an hour to three hours to produce (and sometimes days if you count the breaks in between), an amount of time I can't devote on a daily basis right now. Does it sound like giving up on the challenge? _Yes and no._ Yes, because in literal terms it won't go to completion; no, because perhaps I failed to consider the practicality of such a challenge but will continue to post more often this month than ever before.

I will now focus on writing about things that I had in mind since long, some of which are lying incomplete in my drafts folder. _Stay tuned._
