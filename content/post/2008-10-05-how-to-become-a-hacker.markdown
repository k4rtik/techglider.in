A lot of people ask me "how can I become a hacker"?

I  ask them to differentiate between a hacker and a cracker first and  specify what do they actually want to become. If the answer is a hacker,  I need to direct them to this page (perhaps the best page on the net  for a guide to becoming a hacker): [http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html](http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)

For crackers-to-be I don't have very-healthy feelings and ask them to correct their mindsets.

For all those who can't access the above link because of any restrictions on their network, I have uploaded a copy of the page at [http://techglider.in/misc/hacker-howto.html](../../../misc/hacker-howto.html)

Will try to keep it updated.
