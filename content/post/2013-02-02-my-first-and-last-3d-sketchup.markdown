So, [here is the first one](http://k4rtik.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/28-days-challenge/).

[gallery type="slideshow" ids="512,513,514,515,516"]

I had created this long back in Decemeber of 2006. The file [cab.skp](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10479492/cab.skp) (Google [SketchUp](http://sketchup.google.com/) file) was lying in my system since ages. Tried opening it today, discovered there is no Linux support for its viewer/editor (you listening Google?). After some fiddling with Wine and finally resorting to spend some time on a friend's Windows Laptop, here we are. Quite a piece of art, ain't it? ;-)

**Title:Â **Zebronics GeForce Case 2

**Description:** The glowing big-forehead alien cabinet of my [PlatiniumV2](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1644154190884.2091654.1447742462&type=1&l=f0f82b8b76).

If somebody is interested, I found [a review](http://skajind.blogspot.in/2009/04/zebronics-geforce-case-2-reviews.html) of the cabinet.
