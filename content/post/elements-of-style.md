[![The Elements of Style (Original Edition)](https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1329639702m/6096776.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6096776-the-elements-of-style)[The Elements of Style (Original Edition)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6096776-the-elements-of-style) by [William Strunk Jr.](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6437238.William_Strunk_Jr_)

My rating: [3 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/295816816)

I read the original edition (1918) which is in public domain now (one good and properly hyperlinked version can be found at http://books.cat-v.org/writing/elements-of-style/.

Three stars because much of advice regarding English usage in this book is outdated now. I am aware of the expanded edition by Strunk and White but even that edition is from 1959; I doubt I will gain a lot by reading it. However, I will not mind skimming it sometime.
