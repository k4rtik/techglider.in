> Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.

---Mahatma Gandhi, [Goodreads citation](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2253-live-as-if-you-were-to-die-tomorrow-learn-as) (did not find any authoritative source of this quote)

This used to be my motto for a long time before college, cannot recall when this disappeared from my active conscience. Caught my eye when Prof. Adam Porter quoted this in the announcement email for week 7 of his Coursera class on [Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems](https://www.coursera.org/course/androidpart2). (BTW, this is the max I have come so far with any of my attempts to learn Android programming. I recommend this course but some familiarity with Java is required.)
