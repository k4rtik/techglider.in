All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it&amp;rsquo;s just not that good. It&amp;rsquo;s trying to be good, it has potential, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer.</description></item><item><title>Learn</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2015/03/05/live-as-if-you-were-to-die-tomorrow-learn/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2015 07:13:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2015/03/05/live-as-if-you-were-to-die-tomorrow-learn/</guid><description>Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
&amp;mdash;Mahatma Gandhi, Goodreads citation (did not find any authoritative source of this quote)
This used to be my motto for a long time before college, cannot recall when this disappeared from my active conscience. Caught my eye when Prof. Adam Porter quoted this in the announcement email for week 7 of his Coursera class on Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems.</description></item><item><title>15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2014/11/30/15-commitments-of-conscious-leadership/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2014 12:37:31 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2014/11/30/15-commitments-of-conscious-leadership/</guid><description>Read as &amp;lsquo;commitment&amp;rsquo; and then a &amp;lsquo;counter-commitment&amp;rsquo; for each point.
I commit to taking full responsibility for the circumstances of my life, and my physical, emotional, mental and spiritual wellbeing. I commit to support others to take full responsibility for their lives.
I commit to blaming others and myself for what is wrong in the world. I commit to being a victim, villain, or a hero and taking more or less than 100% responsibility.</description></item><item><title>You literally ought to be asking yourself all...</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2013/11/13/you-literally-ought-to-be-asking-yourself-all/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2013 15:48:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2013/11/13/you-literally-ought-to-be-asking-yourself-all/</guid><description>You literally ought to be asking yourself all of the time - what&amp;rsquo;s the most important thing I could be working on in the world right now; and if you are not working on that, why aren&amp;rsquo;t you?

And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t found it yet, keep looking. Don&amp;rsquo;t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you&amp;rsquo;ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.</description></item><item><title>Twelve voices were shouting in anger and they...</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2013/10/04/twelve-voices-were-shouting-in-anger-and-they/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2013 12:25:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2013/10/04/twelve-voices-were-shouting-in-anger-and-they/</guid><description>Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.

Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.

And if I have something that I really know, it&amp;rsquo;s software. I&amp;rsquo;m a hobbyist in biotech, but I could never go and make a world-class contribution in another field.

This can make or kill your interests. Even Kalam attributes being what he is today to him having great teachers. Unfortunately, this is something which is not under oneâ€™s control.

To give an &amp;ldquo;extensional definition&amp;rdquo; is to point to examples, as adults do when teaching children. The preceding sentence gives an intensional definition of &amp;ldquo;extensional definition&amp;rdquo;, which makes it an extensional example of &amp;ldquo;intensional definition&amp;rdquo;.

The code itself is unimportant; the project is only as useful as people actually find it.

Access to Computers - and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-on Imperative. All information should be free. Mistrust authority - promote decentralization. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race,or position. You can create art and beauty on a computer.</description></item><item><title>The Next Generation of Makers</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2011/04/08/the-next-generation-of-makers-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2011 09:49:41 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2011/04/08/the-next-generation-of-makers-2/</guid><description>I know the future is what I make it.
I believe I can make the world better.
I understand I need knowledge and passion.
I choose to participate, not observe.
I work with my hands and my mind.
I pursue beauty in what I produce.
I see art in science and science in art.
I value skills.
I am the next generation of Maker!
