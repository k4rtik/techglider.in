post.</p><p>I had gone to visit a long time friend and mentor Amarjit at his home. It was
unusual of him to not welcome me at the door himself. I soon learnt why —
<a href=https://malanideepak.wordpress.com/>Deepak</a>
<a href=http://deepak-malani.blogspot.in/>Malani</a> was there!</p><p><img src=/images/me-deepak-amarjit.jpg alt="Me, Deepak, Amarjit" title="Me, Deepak, Amarjit"></p><p>I know Deepak for about 4–5 years now, mostly from stories told by seniors (of
<em>IEEE Glory Days</em>) and from Amarjit himself. We have been in touch on the
Internet on and off for about the same amount of time but had never gotten a
chance to meet in person. That changed today.</p><p>They were &ldquo;meditating&rdquo; (to use a term which Amarjit uses often) over a product
which Deepak and his team have developed.</p><p>I found it quite interesting, here’s a demo video:</p><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJFfnTkyj-g style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div>World’s First Wireless MIDI Controller for Acoustic Guitar —
<a href=http://acpad.com/>ACPAD</a></p><p>But I digress.</p><p>Deepak was in a hurry as he had to be somewhere else soon. After our usual
exchange of updates about work and future plans, and when he was about to leave,
he said something which hit a nerve inside of me: &ldquo;All the best and I will give
you the same advice that I give to most people — <em>document your journey</em>. It
might help others in a way that you can’t think of.&rdquo;</p><p>I have been a great proponent of this very idea <a href=http://techglider.in/post/>since
mid-2008</a>, even encouraging juniors and friends to
do the same. My immediate response to him was pretty casual — &ldquo;I used to write a
lot in college and before, but haven’t written much since I started working. I
should probably start again.&rdquo;</p><p>Not so casual was the fact that the same thought kept circling inside of my head
as I cycled around Bangalore afterwards, from Domlur/Indiranagar to Frazer Town
and back to Jayanagar.</p><p>What had changed? Was it <a href=http://techglider.in/post/2013/07/21/week-1-at-bangalore-and-work/>the job that took away my
freedom</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I am aware now being an employee of a company, I might not be fully open in
sharing my experiences. I will keep sharing things which do not affect my
employer in any way. Of course, it’s to be noted, any opinions shared from now
onwards represent my personal views and do not pertain to my employer at any
level.</p></blockquote><p>Or probably the above was an excuse I kept giving myself to justify not writing.
I think I also tried to justify this by <a href=http://techglider.in/post/2014/11/02/reviews-are-here/>publishing irregular book
reviews</a> on my site.
Probably I had just become too lazy to stop and introspect about things
happening around me, or worse, I had started to live in the past — being content
with all that I had already written — as I had forgotten the original purpose of
my writing: <em>documenting my journey</em>.</p><p>Switching to a static website <a href=http://techglider.in/status/2015/03/16/testing-automatic-deployment-with-wercker/>wasn’t such a good
idea</a>
as well, in retrospect. As good as
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>Markdown</a> may be for short notes or
comments, it lacks many features, most basic and annoying among those being its
inability to even <a href=http://techglider.in/tags/reviews/>align an image</a>; this was
friction enough to put me off from adding new posts to my site. Writing should
be easy, as effortless as it can get; hence, this post belongs on Medium.</p><p>As I <a href=https://www.facebook.com/kartiksinghal/posts/10207536716003174>go back to
academia</a>, I
understand the need to reflect and write more often; more importantly, to record
my life experiences, to share and discuss them with others; this exercise has
helped me grow in past and, I hope, will do the same in future.</p><h3 id=whats-next>What’s next?</h3><p>I have been thinking about writing a couple of posts for sometime:</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>Last day of the first job just got over.
