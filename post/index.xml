I have been hearing about the language debate in India for a while now. My personal philosophy (perhaps) inspired by Gandhi has been to speak in the language that the person I am talking to understands.
Now that I have lived in the US and traveled the world a bit I understand the importance of knowing/learning multiple languages.</description></item><item><title>2016: Year (and a half) in Review</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2016/12/31/2016-year-and-a-half-in-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2016 21:15:39 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2016/12/31/2016-year-and-a-half-in-review/</guid><description>I wanted to write an EoY Review post last year like I did two years ago but I didn&amp;rsquo;t as I was too busy making sure 2016 was beginning with my most important goal for that year&amp;mdash;overcoming my fear of coding and becoming a better programmer. 2016 has been a great year of personal learning and I want to celebrate its passing by documenting some of that learning and experiences.</description></item><item><title>Things I wish I knew in College</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2016/10/01/things-i-wish-i-knew-in-college/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2016 10:51:01 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2016/10/01/things-i-wish-i-knew-in-college/</guid><description>Meta About a month ago, I asked the following question to the NIT Calicut CSE student body:
If you could ask only one question to an NITC CSE alumnus with diverse experience in industry, higher studies, and research, what would you?

How to decide between higher studies and industry as your next career move?

For C++, Exercism encourages a test-driven approach to solving problems and requires some tooling support (CMake) to focus on solving the problem instead of wasting time on setting up a build system for each exercise.</description></item><item><title>Controlling iTunes using Android Wear</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2015/07/14/controlling-itunes-using-android-wear/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 16:58:36 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2015/07/14/controlling-itunes-using-android-wear/</guid><description>I happen to be surrounded by a lot of gadgets lately.

Got my hands on this book about two years ago when Amazon.in was launched and they were giving away some free Kindle books. Started reading it only when the Goodreads Indian Readers group picked this book as their April 2015 read.

I had seen the film adaptation 4-5 years ago but hardly recalled what it was about. Decided to watch it again after I was done with the graphic novel and compare the two.

I had bought this book right away after reading the following tweet from a concerned friend:
It took me another 5 months to actually start reading the book.
Review First two chapters read like a Dan Brown thriller except that you constantly keep reminding yourself that this is not fiction and events leading to the Snowden revelations actually happened this way.</description></item><item><title>100 Days of Grammati</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2015/03/15/100-days-of-grammati/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2015 14:38:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2015/03/15/100-days-of-grammati/</guid><description>Haris had posted the following tweet few months ago:

One word - unputdownable!
Background I am not into reading classics, but chanced upon obtaining the first volume of Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Novels and Stories from a friend. To much of my astonishment, a text written in late 19th century turned out to be really engaging.
Not very comfortable in reading fat books, I started reading out the volume in the form of a sample from Kindle store on my Paperwhite.</description></item><item><title>Habibi by Craig Thompson - A Review</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2014/11/09/habibi-by-craig-thompson-a-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2014 19:20:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2014/11/09/habibi-by-craig-thompson-a-review/</guid><description>Habibi by Craig Thompson
My rating: 5 of 5 stars
At 672 pages, this is probably the longest graphic novel I have read, but one can&amp;rsquo;t go just by the page count, I finished it within 24 hours of acquiring the book from a friend. Yes, it was that engaging.
The book portrays the complicated relationship of two child slaves who meet by chance, grow up together, get separated and meet again, all this while craving for each other&amp;rsquo;s company while facing the hardship of the world.</description></item><item><title>Reviews are here</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2014/11/02/reviews-are-here/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2014 13:56:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2014/11/02/reviews-are-here/</guid><description>After moving to Bangalore Bengaluru over a year ago and starting to work full time, I was beginning to think I had lost touch with writing on my blog completely.

I don&amp;rsquo;t generally pick up fiction books that easily, but when I first read about the book, I found it intriguing. The fact that the book is self-published added to my curiosity.
So, when Sameer approached me over Goodreads and offered a complimentary copy in exchange of an honest review, I was all but happy.</description></item><item><title>reinit</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2014/10/26/reinit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2014 15:04:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2014/10/26/reinit/</guid><description>Today I am relaunching my website - https://techglider.in - in a new avatar.

A first collection of stories &amp;amp; articles from a budding writer friend. Liked the book overall.
The stories are imaginative and much often leave one thinking near the end. Some articles felt lacking in trying to convey the intended meaning, but others especially void Easy(); and The Magic of Reading were quite well written.
Looking forward to a full length book from the author.</description></item><item><title>Review of A Byte of Vim</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2014/04/13/review-of-a-byte-of-vim/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2014 13:10:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2014/04/13/review-of-a-byte-of-vim/</guid><description>A Byte of Vim by Swaroop C.H.

Ended up reading a Hindi book after many years, &amp;lsquo;कथेतर&amp;rsquo; (non-fiction, new word learnt!) on that.
Little Background I haven&amp;rsquo;t followed Kejriwal&amp;rsquo;s or Anna&amp;rsquo;s movement from the beginning. I first gave serious attention when AAP managed to win a substantial number of seats in Delhi last December. Since then, I have come to admire Kejriwal&amp;rsquo;s clarity of thought, his ideas and his mission, all of which can be ascertained in any of his recent interviews or QA&amp;rsquo;s with audience where neither the interviewer nor the public leave any stone unturned to grill him.</description></item><item><title>Review of The Immortals Of Meluha</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2014/03/01/review-of-the-immortals-of-meluha/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2014 12:54:42 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2014/03/01/review-of-the-immortals-of-meluha/</guid><description>The Immortals Of Meluha by Amish Tripathi

Fast paced and interesting. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have read any mythological fiction before and this as a first wasn&amp;rsquo;t a bad start. Hope to finish the trilogy in next few months.
I recall the craze about Shiva trilogy while in college, especially among the folks at LH ;). Written using very simple words, the book re-imagines Shiva as a man and describes his journey in the strange and unfamiliar world of Meluha and beyond.</description></item><item><title>Review of Jaya: An Illustrated Retelling of the Mahabharata</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2014/01/30/review-of-jaya-an-illustrated-retelling-of-the-mahabharata/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2014 12:47:52 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2014/01/30/review-of-jaya-an-illustrated-retelling-of-the-mahabharata/</guid><description>Jaya: An Illustrated Retelling of the Mahabharata by Devdutt Pattanaik

Wanted to read Mahabharata before I moved on to reading some other books which compare their content with Mahabharata and its characters.
I remember reading the condensed version in grade 7 which was part of the syllabus under Hindi literature but never had a chance to go deeper.

Didn&amp;rsquo;t realize the author is a woman before reading the first chapter and looking up her name on Google. Neither did I know she is the one behind Bechdel test (used for identifying gender bias in movies and other works of fiction).

My rating: 5 of 5 stars
Recommended read to understand what Mahatma Gandhi and his ideals of Truth and Ahimsa stood for, in his own words.
Gandhi does full justice with the autobiography not failing to mention incidences from his life which could be termed as objectionable, or embarrassing. His exploration of dietetics, religion, dressing styles and later politics reaffirms my belief in a statement one of my professors made about Gandhi which inspired me to read the book:</description></item><item><title>Review of Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2013/05/30/review-of-surely-youre-joking-mr.-feynman/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2013 09:44:31 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2013/05/30/review-of-surely-youre-joking-mr.-feynman/</guid><description>Surely You&amp;rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman! by Richard P.

A good book that shows the life of a President that India loved, sheds light on the decisions he made that were considered controversial and inspires the leader in one. Not a book for a casual reader, for sure, they might complain it&amp;rsquo;s boring.

Many have told me they found the LaTeX Project Report Template that I published about two years back pretty useful. Today, I am releasing an update for the same. This includes a fix for a nasty bug in the original template apart from some layout changes.

In retrospect, I can see what stopped me in the days I missed - once it was just a tiring day, someday it was work/extended meeting, some day just plain lack of creativity.</description></item><item><title>Quickly Check Temperature Values of Hardware Components in Ubuntu</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2013/02/06/quickly-check-temperature-values-of-hardware-components-in-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2013 15:55:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2013/02/06/quickly-check-temperature-values-of-hardware-components-in-ubuntu/</guid><description>So, I missed posting yesterday.

Today I am sharing a small bash script I wrote to check the temperatures recorded by various sensors in my laptop. Nothing incredibly smart here, just a quick but useful hack.
I am one of those unhappy Linux users who suffer from lack of driver support for their hardware. Due to some weird kernel bug or messy graphics driver, which led to incredibly high temperatures on my laptop, I spent about a year using Linux as a VirtualBox guest in Windows; this was before Ubuntu 12.</description></item><item><title>Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2013/02/03/logicomix-an-epic-search-for-truth/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2013 18:52:40 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2013/02/03/logicomix-an-epic-search-for-truth/</guid><description>This one needs to be quick, 14 minutes until midnight.

My rating: 5 of 5 stars
In my opinion a biography of Jobs can&amp;rsquo;t be better than this - so impartial, detailed and so well researched.
You not only get to learn about a man who perfected convergence of art and technology and changed the way people interact with tech, but also what Apple is about, its ethos and how it was built.
Visiting book stores these days you will found a whole shelf of Steve Jobs biographies, my advice, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the cost and buy this one!</description></item><item><title>(Bangalore) Summer of '12... with BeagleBone</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2012/06/13/bangalore-summer-of-12-with-beaglebone/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jun 2012 16:42:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2012/06/13/bangalore-summer-of-12-with-beaglebone/</guid><description>This post will be slightly long.

Computer Science != Computer Engineering Vineeth Sir always calls it Computing Science, we even had a discussion over it, perhaps over a year back( and once again recently); the doubt got cleared up only after I looked up ACM&amp;rsquo;s Computing Curricula Recommendations which defines five sub-disciplines of computing: Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Systems, Information Technology, and Software Engineering (they have pretty decent comparisons among these disciplines using pictures and charts).</description></item><item><title>Control All Computers in a Lab from a Single System</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2012/02/12/control-all-computers-in-a-lab-from-a-single-system/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2012 03:10:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2012/02/12/control-all-computers-in-a-lab-from-a-single-system/</guid><description>Quoting Dhandeep, our super-cool lab-admin:

In the process, I did learn a few interesting things like the concept of drop catching, how the companies like GoDaddy make so much money; and more importantly how not to lose my domain again.</description></item><item><title>Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams - The Last Lecture</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2011/03/09/really-achieving-your-childhood-dreams-the-last-lecture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2011 19:01:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2011/03/09/really-achieving-your-childhood-dreams-the-last-lecture/</guid><description>I finally got a chance to watch this wonderful talk (by Randy Pausch) popularly known as The Last Lecture.

The default DNS servers your OS uses tend to be very slow.
