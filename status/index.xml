Abstract This paper describes the experience, problems and successes found in implementing a unix-like operating system kernel in rust. Using the basic design and much of the lowest-level support code from the Weenix operating system written for CS167/9 I was able to create a basic kernel supporting multiple kernel processes scheduled cooperatively, drivers for the basic devices and the beginnings of a virtual file system. I made note of where the rust programming language, and its safety and type systems, helped and hindered my work and made some, tentative, performance comparisons between the rust and C implementations of this kernel.</description></item><item><title>First commit of the day.

Found the other book I want to finish reading in the break.
I have always been fascinated by the history and ethos of the Hacker culture. As I work on my OS project over the break, this book should be a great compliment to be continually inspired from and to learn the ways of the early hackers.

For the record: my first all nighter in college was just in last sem (during which Jaseem had to kick me 2-3 times to keep me awake).
And these two were spent properly working on something I love and without facing any loss in productivity during the day. Congrats to myself!</description></item><item><title>Wow Just noticed my blog reached over a...</title><link>techglider.in/status/2011/02/25/wow-just-noticed-my-blog-reached-over-a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2011 10:30:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/status/2011/02/25/wow-just-noticed-my-blog-reached-over-a/</guid><description>Wow!

Dijkstra (transcript availabe on that link). This was suggested by Subhashree mam in our first lecture of Discrete Computational Structures course with her. An interesting read about Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s life and history of the establishment of computing science as a discipline.</description></item><item><title>Discovered today the only two subjects I...</title><link>techglider.in/status/2011/01/20/discovered-today-the-only-two-subjects-i/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2011 15:07:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/status/2011/01/20/discovered-today-the-only-two-subjects-i/</guid><description>Discovered today the only two subjects I am really liking in my 4th sem of BTech:
Data Structures and Algorithms - no attendance, low strength, more discussion possible in Sudeep Sir&amp;rsquo;s class Computer Organization - I think I was always more inclined towards hardware and internals of computer system, assembly language programming comes as a bonus part with this course</description></item><item><title>Just installed QtSpim - the latest versi...</title><link>techglider.in/status/2011/01/14/just-installed-qtspim-the-latest-versi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2011 04:34:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/status/2011/01/14/just-installed-qtspim-the-latest-versi/</guid><description>Just installed QtSpim - the latest version of SPIM MIPS Simulator, hope to do start with some assembly coding soon.</description></item><item><title>Just discovered accidentally - In GMail ...</title><link>techglider.in/status/2010/12/28/just-discovered-accidentally-in-gmail/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2010 06:43:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/status/2010/12/28/just-discovered-accidentally-in-gmail/</guid><description>Just discovered accidentally - In GMail chat, if you surround text with 2 underscores or 2 stars, they show up as italicized and bold text respectively in the chat. For example: _hello_ gets converted to hello and *world* to world.

When you are pissed off at somebody, and you&amp;rsquo;re angry at them, you just haven&amp;rsquo;t given them enough time. Just give them a little more time — and they&amp;rsquo;ll almost always impress you.</description></item><item><title>Here is a video about the features of th...</title><link>techglider.in/status/2010/12/20/wpvideo-yynw9isj/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2010 08:06:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/status/2010/12/20/wpvideo-yynw9isj/</guid><description>Here is a video about the features of the theme I am using:

And it was the last one ever. I am so grateful to Praveen because of whom I made up my mind to attend it. I badly needed a change in my thinking process which this foss.in has succeeded in bringing.
