The main reason has been some or other problem with my website&amp;rsquo;s hosting server until it was shifted to another one in early Feb. But after this happened it&amp;rsquo;s some strange problem in the campus network that my website is only accessible at certain unexpected times as now. While writing this I am not sure, I will be able to publish this post or not, as the site seems accessible at completely random times and duration.</description></item><item><title>Wish I was at Shaastra 2009 HackFest</title><link>techglider.in/post/2009/10/03/wish-i-was-at-shaastra-2009-hackfest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2009 16:37:42 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2009/10/03/wish-i-was-at-shaastra-2009-hackfest/</guid><description>Was just reading my twitter timeline when my eyes dropped on this tweet by Atul Chitnis:
achitnis: Small report about my talk at the IITM on the 1st: http://tinyurl.com/yaa58xe
The link points to Shaastra 2009 Hackfest – Day 1. After reading this page, I realize I have missed a great chance.
It was this last Saturady, I was trying so hard to get a railway ticket to Chennai to visit Shaastra 2009 at IIT Madras.</description></item></channel></rss>
