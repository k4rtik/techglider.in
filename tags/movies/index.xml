My rating: 4.5 of 5 stars
I had seen the film adaptation 4-5 years ago but hardly recalled what it was about. Decided to watch it again after I was done with the graphic novel and compare the two.
The Graphic Novel First couple of volumes in the 10-volume series didn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense and were rather slow to read as I was just getting introduced to the characters.</description></item></channel></rss>
