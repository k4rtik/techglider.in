One of them is a pretty Moto 360, one of the early Android Wear watches:
and another a MacBook Air (PlatiniumAir) which is about to celebrate its first anniversary:
This morning while walking-reading in my room, I had iTunes on the MacBook playing some tracks from one of the auto-generated Apple Music playlists. Now, it’s fairly easy to flick away mobile (lying away on my desk) notifications using my watch and not interrupt my reading for more than a couple seconds.</description></item><item><title>(Bangalore) Summer of '12... with BeagleBone</title><link>techglider.in/post/2012/06/13/bangalore-summer-of-12-with-beaglebone/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jun 2012 16:42:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2012/06/13/bangalore-summer-of-12-with-beaglebone/</guid><description>This post will be slightly long. Lots of exciting things happening over a Bangalore summer this year for me. :D
Somehow I always wanted to learn more about hardware and with a mentor like Khasim the road seems a lot more exciting. I first met him when he came to conduct a workshop on BeagleBoard during Tathva 2009 at my college - NIT Calicut. I was just a fresher then and have since regretted that I could not attend that workshop completely (due to my participation in various CS related competitions).</description></item><item><title>Root Samsung Galaxy S i9000 running GINGERBREAD.DDJV6 using Ubuntu Linux</title><link>techglider.in/post/2011/06/21/root-samsung-galaxy-s-i9000-running-gingerbread-ddjv6-using-ubuntu-linux/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2011 17:01:54 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2011/06/21/root-samsung-galaxy-s-i9000-running-gingerbread-ddjv6-using-ubuntu-linux/</guid><description>I bought a Samsung Galaxy S i9000 just last month. The most prominent reason to buy an Android phone was that it&amp;rsquo;s based on Linux and I love the UNIX-based OS. Besides, Android as a platform provides so many opportunities into application development (and even kernel hacking) that I was simply tempted to buy one since last year.
I have explored the phone since I got my hands on it - trying various apps, playing with 3G internet speeds (3.</description></item><item><title>Current Android App List</title><link>techglider.in/post/2011/06/11/current-android-app-list/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2011 13:20:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2011/06/11/current-android-app-list/</guid><description>Alchemy: http://market.android.com/details?id=me.zed_0xff.android.alchemy

After a little Googling, I found out the easiest way to turn a laptop into a WiFi Hot Spot (for uses such as sharing Internet connection with my Android phone) - Virtual Router and now I am enjoying fast internet on my phone.
As I call the above the easiest, it&amp;rsquo;s not the best method and doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer much features either.</description></item><item><title>Choosing an Android Phone - Not an Easy Job</title><link>techglider.in/post/2011/05/23/choosing-an-android-phone-not-an-easy-job/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2011 16:42:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2011/05/23/choosing-an-android-phone-not-an-easy-job/</guid><description>Little background It&amp;rsquo;s almost a month now since I sold my old Nokia N72 (fondly named PlatiniumJunior by me), hoping to buy an Android-based smartphone soon. Since then, I have realized how dependent I was on the phone - thinking of taking a quick snap and realizing I don&amp;rsquo;t have a camera anymore is disappointing, same is getting stuck at a word while reading and missing that MSDict software on my phone which was always ready as a quick reference, similar is being jobless at places I am forced to visit at times (or when there were power outages of countless hours at home, more on this in another post) and missing the phone again which I could use to read some or other ebook.</description></item></channel></rss>
