I will be living in some other place for the first time ever in my life. I want to admit, if I had not dropped the year, this may have happened more than a month ago (moving into hostel of some great college, I would have taken admission into).
So, what has happened is that due to LARGE commuting time for attending classes at FIITJEE (5 hours commute time for a 4 hour session), I have been forced to take up a room at Delhi and reside there.</description></item></channel></rss>
