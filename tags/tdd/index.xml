Since, (re-)learning a language requires both reading and writing code, I decided to work through some exercises on Exercism.
For C++, Exercism encourages a test-driven approach to solving problems and requires some tooling support (CMake) to focus on solving the problem instead of wasting time on setting up a build system for each exercise.</description></item></channel></rss>
