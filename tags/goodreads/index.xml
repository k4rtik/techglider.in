This week after stumbling upon a fellow BBC member&amp;rsquo;s book blog, it occurred to me &amp;mdash; I actually had been writing book reviews on Goodreads all this while!
In the spirit of keeping all my written (and hopefully useful) content here, I decided to migrate the read-worthy reviews here.</description></item><item><title>Week 1 at Bangalore and Work</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2013/07/21/week-1-at-bangalore-and-work/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2013 14:53:31 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2013/07/21/week-1-at-bangalore-and-work/</guid><description>I landed at Bangalore airport last week flying on an indiGo for the first time; found the experience better than JetKonnect from my first flight.
Next day (Sunday) started early with a walk to Oracle Tech Park and back to get myself familiarized with the area before first day at work. A much-needed haircut followed.
Having caught cold with the change in weather, I had to miss the Goodreads meetup planned at Brigade Road during the day, whichÂ I was eagerly awaiting to attend with a friend.</description></item></channel></rss>
