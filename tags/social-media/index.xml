I deactivated my Facebook account sometime in the first week of Feb; it has been over 75 days. I did try activating it once after 30 days were over and realized within a couple of hours, how ugly and consumeristic this part of the Internet is and since then had not tried logging in again until last night.</description></item><item><title>Wasted Hours</title><link>https://techglider.in/status/2016/04/10/wasted-hours/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2016 16:03:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/status/2016/04/10/wasted-hours/</guid><description>http://www.listen-tome.com/wasted-hours/

A small announcement: I will be out of touch for about a week on the Internet. Disconnected on all social networks (including twitter) and off-line on chats (including GMail chat) and unavailable on SMS. I have already disabled all email and SMS notifications from the social networks. This is just for the sake of experimenting to see if I can still live without social media, so don&amp;rsquo;t get weird ideas about this.</description></item></channel></rss>
