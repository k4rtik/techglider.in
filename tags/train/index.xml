I just tried to this yesterday on my N72 and want to tell you that it&amp;rsquo;s a great fun to do and a finer way to cut time we waste in commuting (than listening to music or playing games on our mobile).
Of course you need to know programming in order to utilize your phone in this manner.</description></item><item><title>That hard and tiring day of July 31</title><link>techglider.in/post/2008/08/05/that-hard-and-tiring-day-of-july-31/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2008 14:22:47 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2008/08/05/that-hard-and-tiring-day-of-july-31/</guid><description>I mentioned about this day in my post of August 1.
I started the day at night by wishing aÂ friend birthday, eventually making her wakeup at midnight. Then, came the inauguration of my website with my first post on The TechGlider Blog at 6 in the morning. This was the easy part of the day.
I reached the Ghaziabad Railway Station at 7:50 to board the train to Tilak Bridge at Delhi, for I use to go to South Delhi to attend FIITJEE classes for IIT-JEE preparation.</description></item></channel></rss>
