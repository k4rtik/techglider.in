Started in July 2008, gone in July 2010. :(
The reason of this long absence: I lost the ownership of the domain techglider.com - partly because of my own carelessness, and partly because of my webhost Four &amp;lsquo;S&amp;rsquo; Tech&amp;rsquo;s troubles. In the process, I did learn a few interesting things like the concept of drop catching, how the companies like GoDaddy make so much money; and more importantly how not to lose my domain again.</description></item><item><title>Checking BSNL broadband usage</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2008/12/07/checking-bsnl-broadband-usage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2008 13:34:03 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2008/12/07/checking-bsnl-broadband-usage/</guid><description>On older connections (before december 2007) broadband usage check can be done on one of the following IP addresses:
http://10.240.64.195
http://10.240.89.199
http://10.240.128.195
http://10.240.16.195
http://10.240.144.195
If one address doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, you can try another one. I happened to use the 4th IP address for a lot of months and one day it stopped working; now I am using the 2nd IP address from the above list.</description></item><item><title>Finally a website of my own!</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2008/07/31/finally-a-website-of-my-own/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2008 00:44:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2008/07/31/finally-a-website-of-my-own/</guid><description>Hello there, :-) This is Kartik Singhal.
Well, finally done selecting a domain name (this was the most interesting part of the whole process), buying webspace and setting up this blog (quite complex a process, though) and I have my own website now!
I will introduce you to my ideas and future plans for this website here.
Please wait for my second post as it happens tonight with all the info I have to offer about this website.</description></item></channel></rss>
