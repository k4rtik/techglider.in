But it&amp;rsquo;s how it is, I have been busy and I am busy with studies atleast for another 3 months. And I am happy about it.
A lot has happened in between - that includes my leaving the room at Kalu Sarai (and start of the &amp;ldquo;then usual&amp;rdquo; up-downs from home to IIT Gate for classes); a lot of AITS tests which went bad as compared to my standards, leaving me bewildered at my scores; and some blows on my face that got me right on track.</description></item></channel></rss>
