After trying multiple file recovery tools like TestDisk/PhotoRec, Recuva, etc. I had ran chkdsk (of course, from Windows) as a last resort on that particular partition last night. Since, Windows doesn&amp;rsquo;t show protected system files easily I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the content of found.000 directory that got created in the said partition. I made a mental note of checking this directory out later from Linux.</description></item><item><title>Another strange thing and a big lesson learned...</title><link>techglider.in/status/2013/04/19/another-strange-thing-and-a-big-lesson-learned/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2013 14:55:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/status/2013/04/19/another-strange-thing-and-a-big-lesson-learned/</guid><description>Another strange thing and a big lesson learned today was regarding disk handling by Windows and Linux.

This will be quite short.
Many have told me they found the LaTeX Project Report Template that I published about two years back pretty useful. Today, I am releasing an update for the same. This includes a fix for a nasty bug in the original template apart from some layout changes.

Today I am sharing a small bash script I wrote to check the temperatures recorded by various sensors in my laptop. Nothing incredibly smart here, just a quick but useful hack.
I am one of those unhappy Linux users who suffer from lack of driver support for their hardware. Due to some weird kernel bug or messy graphics driver, which led to incredibly high temperatures on my laptop, I spent about a year using Linux as a VirtualBox guest in Windows; this was before Ubuntu 12.</description></item><item><title>Best Tool for Downloading YouTube Videos and Playlists</title><link>techglider.in/post/2012/07/13/best-tool-for-downloading-youtube-videos-and-playlists/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2012 18:30:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2012/07/13/best-tool-for-downloading-youtube-videos-and-playlists/</guid><description>How many times does it happen that you stumble upon an awesome youtube video, you make up your mind to download it but fail short to find a good tool which actually works?

Boot the system using a Ubuntu Live disk.
After you reach the desktop, open Terminal (press Alt+F2, type &amp;ldquo;gnome-terminal&amp;rdquo; without quotes and press enter).
Execute:
``` sudo fdisk -l ``` Execute (after replacing sda7 with your corresponding linux root partition, which you will be able to identify from the output of the previous command - it&amp;rsquo;s usually marked as Linux): ``` sudo mount /dev/sda7 /mnt ``` Just check whether you got the root partition right, if you have more than 1 linux partition on your hard disk: ``` cd /mnt ls ``` If the listing contains names like bin, boot, dev, etc, home, tmp, usr, var, et cetera then you are in the right partition.</description></item><item><title>Recommended Linux Partitioning Scheme</title><link>techglider.in/post/2011/06/23/recommended-linux-partitioning-scheme/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2011 18:30:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2011/06/23/recommended-linux-partitioning-scheme/</guid><description>Partitioning Basics: When we need to install linux on our systems, we need to partition our hard disk as we do for windows.
