One of them is a pretty Moto 360, one of the early Android Wear watches:
and another a MacBook Air (PlatiniumAir) which is about to celebrate its first anniversary:
This morning while walking-reading in my room, I had iTunes on the MacBook playing some tracks from one of the auto-generated Apple Music playlists. Now, itâ€™s fairly easy to flick away mobile (lying away on my desk) notifications using my watch and not interrupt my reading for more than a couple seconds.</description></item><item><title>It feels so relieving to get your lost...</title><link>https://techglider.in/status/2013/04/20/it-feels-so-relieving-to-get-your-lost/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2013 12:16:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/status/2013/04/20/it-feels-so-relieving-to-get-your-lost/</guid><description>It feels so relieving to get your lost data back!
After trying multiple file recovery tools like TestDisk/PhotoRec, Recuva, etc. I had ran chkdsk (of course, from Windows) as a last resort on that particular partition last night. Since, Windows doesn&amp;rsquo;t show protected system files easily I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the content of found.000 directory that got created in the said partition. I made a mental note of checking this directory out later from Linux.</description></item><item><title>Another strange thing and a big lesson learned...</title><link>https://techglider.in/status/2013/04/19/another-strange-thing-and-a-big-lesson-learned/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2013 14:55:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/status/2013/04/19/another-strange-thing-and-a-big-lesson-learned/</guid><description>Another strange thing and a big lesson learned today was regarding disk handling by Windows and Linux. I had been observing missing files from my hard disk for a few weeks now, always suspected it was due to bad sectors but tests didn&amp;rsquo;t turn up anything positive. When I took the backup of my old Ubuntu home directory to an NTFS partition, installed Linux Mint and then tried to access the backup I was left with a shock - the whole backup was gone!</description></item><item><title>Quickly Check Temperature Values of Hardware Components in Ubuntu</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2013/02/06/quickly-check-temperature-values-of-hardware-components-in-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2013 15:55:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2013/02/06/quickly-check-temperature-values-of-hardware-components-in-ubuntu/</guid><description>So, I missed posting yesterday. Hope this doesn&amp;rsquo;t repeat.
Today I am sharing a small bash script I wrote to check the temperatures recorded by various sensors in my laptop. Nothing incredibly smart here, just a quick but useful hack.
I am one of those unhappy Linux users who suffer from lack of driver support for their hardware. Due to some weird kernel bug or messy graphics driver, which led to incredibly high temperatures on my laptop, I spent about a year using Linux as a VirtualBox guest in Windows; this was before Ubuntu 12.</description></item><item><title>UNIX is basically a simple operating system but...</title><link>https://techglider.in/quote/2011/10/13/unix-is-basically-a-simple-operating-system-but/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2011 08:36:16 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/quote/2011/10/13/unix-is-basically-a-simple-operating-system-but/</guid><description>UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity.

In the case of windows, partitions are called as c: ,d:, e:, etc. But on linux they are represented in the form of following (there are many others, but these are the most essential):
swap: This is meant for use by the system when it runs out of memory (RAM); it&amp;rsquo;s much like virtual memory in windows where the system utilizes that space as extra memory.</description></item></channel></rss>
