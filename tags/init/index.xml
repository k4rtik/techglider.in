This completes migration of all my written content. Fixing broken links, images, etc. is the major work that remains.
Aside:
I ended up skimming through much of my old content, feels very childish now; my friends from that time might get a laugh or two reading about memories recorded in here.</description></item><item><title>reinit</title><link>techglider.in/post/2014/10/26/reinit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2014 15:04:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2014/10/26/reinit/</guid><description>Today I am relaunching my website - http://techglider.in - in a new avatar. This, in the form of techglider.com, used to be my first website on the Internet until the .com domain was stolen by a domain shark. Sometime later, I switched to writing on wordpress.com and stopped maintaining this site.
A constant feeling of not having an official web home and a permanent place to put my thoughts out for the world has been nagging me for months, this reinit is the first step in solving this problem.</description></item><item><title>New beginning</title><link>techglider.in/status/2013/05/23/new-beginning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2013 11:42:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/status/2013/05/23/new-beginning/</guid><description>Note: This is an archived post from my unmaintained Tumblr blog https://k4rtik.tumblr.com</description></item></channel></rss>
