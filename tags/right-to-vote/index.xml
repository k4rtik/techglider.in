Ok let me make things clear: I voted for the first time.
I am 19 and as many other adolescents was excited to be able to vote after turning 18. But last year I didn&amp;rsquo;t get my EPIC (Elector&amp;rsquo;s Photo Identity Card) as you are supposed to be 18 on January 1st of the year to be eligible for voting.</description></item></channel></rss>
