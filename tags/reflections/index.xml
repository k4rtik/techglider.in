If you could ask only one question to an NITC CSE alumnus with diverse experience in industry, higher studies, and research, what would you?
The most raised concerns were:
How to decide between higher studies and industry as your next career move? What are the limitations of an NITC CSE education and how to succeed in the field despite them?</description></item><item><title>Reflections on the Facebook Sannyasa</title><link>techglider.in/post/2016/04/24/reflections-on-the-facebook-sannyasa/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2016 06:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2016/04/24/reflections-on-the-facebook-sannyasa/</guid><description>As some of you reading this might be aware I have been away for a while.
I deactivated my Facebook account sometime in the first week of Feb; it has been over 75 days. I did try activating it once after 30 days were over and realized within a couple of hours, how ugly and consumeristic this part of the Internet is and since then had not tried logging in again until last night.</description></item><item><title>Java</title><link>techglider.in/post/2016/01/02/java/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2016 22:51:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2016/01/02/java/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t really recall why I avoided Java all this while.
Few weeks after arriving here at Brown, I learnt Brown is, what they call, a Java school. That&amp;rsquo;s probably not completely true, but for a vast majority of students that take Andy&amp;rsquo;s intro class, CS15, it is. I have come to realize it is not such a bad thing (quite the opposite).

A sudden surge of conscientiousness about taking my education in my hands was one of the immediate results.

I didn’t do my best, but was humbled by Cantrill into realizing how much I had to learn.</description></item><item><title>On Blogging</title><link>techglider.in/post/2015/06/28/on-blogging/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2015 23:40:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2015/06/28/on-blogging/</guid><description>Something interesting happened this morning which leads to existence of this post.
I had gone to visit a long time friend and mentor Amarjit at his home. It was unusual of him to not welcome me at the door himself. I soon learnt why — Deepak Malani was there!
I know Deepak for about 4–5 years now, mostly from stories told by seniors (of IEEE Glory Days) and from Amarjit himself.</description></item></channel></rss>
