If you could ask only one question to an NITC CSE alumnus with diverse experience in industry, higher studies, and research, what would you?
The most raised concerns were:
How to decide between higher studies and industry as your next career move? What are the limitations of an NITC CSE education and how to succeed in the field despite them?</description></item><item><title>2014: Year in Review</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2014/12/31/2014-year-in-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2014 23:59:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2014/12/31/2014-year-in-review/</guid><description>Books If I had to describe what my year was about in just one word, it would be these. I was surrounded by books, all sorts of them, throughout the year. I had set out a goal to read 26 full-length books, ie, one per fortnight over the year. I was following the plan until May, when I rediscoverd my love for comic books with the launch of Amar Chitra Katha Android app and the 12 comic books that came free with it.</description></item><item><title>even if you wrote 100% of the code...</title><link>https://techglider.in/quote/2011/10/04/even-if-you-wrote-100-of-the-code/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2011 12:43:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/quote/2011/10/04/even-if-you-wrote-100-of-the-code/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;even if you wrote 100% of the code, and even if you are the best programmer in the world and will never need any help with the project at all, the thing that really matters is the users of the code.

I ask them to differentiate between a hacker and a cracker first and specify what do they actually want to become. If the answer is a hacker, I need to direct them to this page (perhaps the best page on the net for a guide to becoming a hacker): http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html
For crackers-to-be I don&amp;rsquo;t have very-healthy feelings and ask them to correct their mindsets.</description></item><item><title>What to do after a new Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron installation?</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2008/09/08/what-to-do-after-a-new-ubuntu-8-04-hardy-heron-installation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2008 10:52:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2008/09/08/what-to-do-after-a-new-ubuntu-8-04-hardy-heron-installation/</guid><description>After Install Tasks Have your internet connection ready.
