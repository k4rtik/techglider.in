These were shared with my friend Arvis on June 28, 2009 for his comments.
The following was the outcome of earlier designs on July 5, 2009:

So, I found one kturtle using Synaptic Package Manager and tried to test it on my own PC. My bad luck, it was like logo but had a different syntax.</description></item><item><title>How to become a Hacker?</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2008/10/05/how-to-become-a-hacker/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2008 08:21:49 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2008/10/05/how-to-become-a-hacker/</guid><description>A lot of people ask me &amp;ldquo;how can I become a hacker&amp;rdquo;?
I ask them to differentiate between a hacker and a cracker first and specify what do they actually want to become. If the answer is a hacker, I need to direct them to this page (perhaps the best page on the net for a guide to becoming a hacker): http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html
For crackers-to-be I don&amp;rsquo;t have very-healthy feelings and ask them to correct their mindsets.</description></item><item><title>TechGlider logo, finally designed</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2008/09/30/techglider-logo-finally-designed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2008 04:48:54 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2008/09/30/techglider-logo-finally-designed/</guid><description>I am happy :-) to inform all of you that I have finally designed a logo for the TechGlider:
Although I am not that satisfied with the logo, but I think it will do for the time being. Any suggestions for improvement of the logo are welcome.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish the development of TechGlider this week (designing a logo really takes too much of time ;-)</description></item><item><title>Mainstream development of TechGlider in full flow</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2008/09/23/mainstream-development-of-techglider-in-full-flow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2008 00:31:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2008/09/23/mainstream-development-of-techglider-in-full-flow/</guid><description>And, I came back earlier by a week from the schedule.
I am happy to announce that the start of the next week (hopefully) will see the rise of TechGlider in its full avatar; fully loaded with most of stuff I have to offer.
I have got certain idea of what is going to be the logo for the TechGlider and will be designing it on paper in this week. The main site is no longer hidden: you are no longer directed to this TechGlider Blog on typing www.</description></item><item><title>It's a Monthiversary!!</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2008/08/31/its-a-monthiversary/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2008 00:03:57 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2008/08/31/its-a-monthiversary/</guid><description>Today, it&amp;rsquo;s been a month I started out posting on this blog.
And I feel happy about it. 11 posts in a month; it may seem too less to some of you, but, for me: I suppose I have been keeping up to my goal of writing regularly (and improving by the day :-) ).
I know I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to fulfill certain promises I made on the blog viz: guide to installing Ubuntu and unveiling the main TechGlider site.</description></item></channel></rss>
