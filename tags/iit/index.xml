But it&amp;rsquo;s how it is, I have been busy and I am busy with studies atleast for another 3 months. And I am happy about it.
A lot has happened in between - that includes my leaving the room at Kalu Sarai (and start of the &amp;ldquo;then usual&amp;rdquo; up-downs from home to IIT Gate for classes); a lot of AITS tests which went bad as compared to my standards, leaving me bewildered at my scores; and some blows on my face that got me right on track.</description></item><item><title>I have found Happiness</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2008/12/09/i-have-found-happiness/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2008 16:27:07 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2008/12/09/i-have-found-happiness/</guid><description>It was this time that I spent a whole 8 days continuously at Kalu Sarai, not coming back to my home for the weekend. Now, I am back and I remember how these days went by&amp;hellip;
Thursday, November 27 - Friday, December 5 The Situation: We have our first All India Test Series exam on Sunday, the 30th.
The Scene: I have decided not to take a look at Calculus; for I had just given a Phase Test on the topic last Sunday.</description></item><item><title>It's decided: IIT first, Web Development later</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2008/11/22/its-decided-iit-first-web-development-later/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2008 05:15:06 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2008/11/22/its-decided-iit-first-web-development-later/</guid><description>Why? It&amp;rsquo;s the time I have decided to stop thinking about the development of TechGlider.com as for the last 2 months I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to do any remarkable work mostly because of being unable to organize my ideas and put them into practice in short periods of 1-2 days I get home for in a week.
The burden of study is more and I need to focus on that, forgetting everything else in the world now (after all JEE-2009 is less than 5 months ahead).</description></item></channel></rss>
