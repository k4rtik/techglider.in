These were shared with my friend Arvis on June 28, 2009 for his comments.
The following was the outcome of earlier designs on July 5, 2009:

Started in July 2008, gone in July 2010. :(
The reason of this long absence: I lost the ownership of the domain techglider.com - partly because of my own carelessness, and partly because of my webhost Four &amp;lsquo;S&amp;rsquo; Tech&amp;rsquo;s troubles. In the process, I did learn a few interesting things like the concept of drop catching, how the companies like GoDaddy make so much money; and more importantly how not to lose my domain again.</description></item><item><title>A Simple Tic Tac Toe Game in C</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/11/12/a-simple-tic-tac-toe-game-in-c/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2009 13:24:53 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/11/12/a-simple-tic-tac-toe-game-in-c/</guid><description>Tic Tac Toe (T3), a two-player game developed in C/C++ in 2006-2007
For the school project in C++ in standard 11, I chose to make a game. Although the game doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature AI, it demonstrates the graphics and sound capabilities of C/C++ with Turbo C++ compiler.
Here is the link to the code (I can&amp;rsquo;t support it any more, so please don&amp;rsquo;t ask if you are unable to run it.):</description></item><item><title>How to become a Hacker?</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/10/05/how-to-become-a-hacker/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2008 08:21:49 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/10/05/how-to-become-a-hacker/</guid><description>A lot of people ask me &amp;ldquo;how can I become a hacker&amp;rdquo;?
I ask them to differentiate between a hacker and a cracker first and specify what do they actually want to become. If the answer is a hacker, I need to direct them to this page (perhaps the best page on the net for a guide to becoming a hacker): http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html
For crackers-to-be I don&amp;rsquo;t have very-healthy feelings and ask them to correct their mindsets.</description></item><item><title>Finally a website of my own!</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/07/31/finally-a-website-of-my-own/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2008 00:44:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/07/31/finally-a-website-of-my-own/</guid><description>Hello there, :-) This is Kartik Singhal.
Well, finally done selecting a domain name (this was the most interesting part of the whole process), buying webspace and setting up this blog (quite complex a process, though) and I have my own website now!
I will introduce you to my ideas and future plans for this website here.
Please wait for my second post as it happens tonight with all the info I have to offer about this website.</description></item></channel></rss>
