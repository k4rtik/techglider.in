Why? Because my previous SIM was incompatible with my N72 (Platinium Junior, let&amp;rsquo;s call it PJ for convenience). How? It said &amp;lsquo;Invalid SIM&amp;rsquo; on switching it on with the SIM (although somehow I had managed one whole semester with the same SIM in the PJ as the damned thing worked on restarting the phone 2-3 times, but in December I realized, the SIM can&amp;rsquo;t go far with PJ anymore).</description></item></channel></rss>
