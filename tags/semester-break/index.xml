After spending more than 4 months here at NIT Calicut, I am finally going back home.
This period starting from AIEEE 2009 counseling in July has been an amazing roller coaster ride for me. Many wonderful things happened with me. I got admission to a college whose image I had always seen in my dreams. That too in the same branch, i.e. Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering, except for which I knew I could never excel in any other engineering branch.</description></item></channel></rss>
