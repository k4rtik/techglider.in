This will be quite short.
Many have told me they found the LaTeX Project Report Template that I published about two years back pretty useful. Today, I am releasing an update for the same. This includes a fix for a nasty bug in the original template apart from some layout changes.
Fork it from Github at https://github.com/k4rtik/latex-project-report-template to start creating your project reports.Visit http://k4rtik.</description></item><item><title>Quickly Check Temperature Values of Hardware Components in Ubuntu</title><link>techglider.in/post/2013/02/06/quickly-check-temperature-values-of-hardware-components-in-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2013 15:55:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2013/02/06/quickly-check-temperature-values-of-hardware-components-in-ubuntu/</guid><description>So, I missed posting yesterday. Hope this doesn&amp;rsquo;t repeat.
Today I am sharing a small bash script I wrote to check the temperatures recorded by various sensors in my laptop. Nothing incredibly smart here, just a quick but useful hack.
I am one of those unhappy Linux users who suffer from lack of driver support for their hardware. Due to some weird kernel bug or messy graphics driver, which led to incredibly high temperatures on my laptop, I spent about a year using Linux as a VirtualBox guest in Windows; this was before Ubuntu 12.</description></item><item><title>Best Tool for Downloading YouTube Videos and Playlists</title><link>techglider.in/post/2012/07/13/best-tool-for-downloading-youtube-videos-and-playlists/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2012 18:30:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2012/07/13/best-tool-for-downloading-youtube-videos-and-playlists/</guid><description>How many times does it happen that you stumble upon an awesome youtube video, you make up your mind to download it but fail short to find a good tool which actually works?

And after installing Windows, you can&amp;rsquo;t load Ubuntu again, just follow the steps to get this working:
Boot the system using a Ubuntu Live disk.
After you reach the desktop, open Terminal (press Alt+F2, type &amp;ldquo;gnome-terminal&amp;rdquo; without quotes and press enter).
Execute:
``` sudo fdisk -l ``` Execute (after replacing sda7 with your corresponding linux root partition, which you will be able to identify from the output of the previous command - it&amp;rsquo;s usually marked as Linux): ``` sudo mount /dev/sda7 /mnt ``` Just check whether you got the root partition right, if you have more than 1 linux partition on your hard disk: ``` cd /mnt ls ``` If the listing contains names like bin, boot, dev, etc, home, tmp, usr, var, et cetera then you are in the right partition.</description></item><item><title>Input/Output using Text Files Without Diving into File Handling</title><link>techglider.in/post/2011/02/10/inputoutput-using-text-files-without-diving-into-file-handling/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2011 10:18:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2011/02/10/inputoutput-using-text-files-without-diving-into-file-handling/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to use text files as input source or to redirect the output of programs to files if you happen to do programming on a unix/linux terminal.

And all my fears regarding Linux being so different when it came to file recovery (unlike Windows, where you had a choice of many recovery software) and it was next to impossible to undelete files from linux, seemed to come true. A quick search in Ubuntu Software Center listed a software called &amp;lsquo;recover&amp;rsquo; which was meant only for ext2 partitions, and mine being ext4 I was hopeless.</description></item></channel></rss>
