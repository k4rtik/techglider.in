Was facing this problem at least since last October when I tried to install latest editions of Fedora and ArchLinux but couldn&amp;rsquo;t. On Linux Mint 14 Cinnamon now.</description></item><item><title>Quickly Check Temperature Values of Hardware Components in Ubuntu</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2013/02/06/quickly-check-temperature-values-of-hardware-components-in-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2013 15:55:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2013/02/06/quickly-check-temperature-values-of-hardware-components-in-ubuntu/</guid><description>So, I missed posting yesterday. Hope this doesn&amp;rsquo;t repeat.
Today I am sharing a small bash script I wrote to check the temperatures recorded by various sensors in my laptop. Nothing incredibly smart here, just a quick but useful hack.
I am one of those unhappy Linux users who suffer from lack of driver support for their hardware. Due to some weird kernel bug or messy graphics driver, which led to incredibly high temperatures on my laptop, I spent about a year using Linux as a VirtualBox guest in Windows; this was before Ubuntu 12.</description></item><item><title>Use rfkill to Enable/Disable Wireless on your Linux Laptop</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2011/06/29/use-rfkill-to-enabledisable-wireless-on-your-linux-laptop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2011 18:30:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2011/06/29/use-rfkill-to-enabledisable-wireless-on-your-linux-laptop/</guid><description>Imagine a situation when you have to book an air/train ticket in a jiffy, or check an important mail quickly and the only option you have is a wi-fi connection from either your smart phone or surroundings, and you have only some Linux variant installed on your system. And even after installing all the necessary drivers, you are unable to get the wi-fi on your laptop working? Frustrating right? If yes, then you might want to read on about this useful utility called rfkill which you can keep in handy for those weary situations.</description></item><item><title>Choosing an Android Phone - Not an Easy Job</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2011/05/23/choosing-an-android-phone-not-an-easy-job/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2011 16:42:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2011/05/23/choosing-an-android-phone-not-an-easy-job/</guid><description>Little background It&amp;rsquo;s almost a month now since I sold my old Nokia N72 (fondly named PlatiniumJunior by me), hoping to buy an Android-based smartphone soon. Since then, I have realized how dependent I was on the phone - thinking of taking a quick snap and realizing I don&amp;rsquo;t have a camera anymore is disappointing, same is getting stuck at a word while reading and missing that MSDict software on my phone which was always ready as a quick reference, similar is being jobless at places I am forced to visit at times (or when there were power outages of countless hours at home, more on this in another post) and missing the phone again which I could use to read some or other ebook.</description></item><item><title>Replaced my Studio XPS screen and palm rest</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2010/12/23/replaced-my-studio-xps-screen-and-palm-rest/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2010 11:47:26 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2010/12/23/replaced-my-studio-xps-screen-and-palm-rest/</guid><description>Got my laptop screen and palm rest, touch pad replaced :) But all my stickers - Drupal, Hacker Logo, Python, Firefox, Core i7, Windows 7 - and RMS&amp;rsquo; signature are gone :(</description></item></channel></rss>
