I visited Navyug Market yesterday with Mukul for some quick and cheap photostats (@ Rs. 0.75 per page). After coming out of the shop, Mukul pointed towards this vendor which caught my eye.
I was bit in a hurry but couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop the temptation of taking a snap. I asked the vendor whether I could take a photo. The Chhole Wala (in the center) agreed with a smile and said &amp;ldquo;Arrey kyun nahin?</description></item><item><title>Going away from home....</title><link>https://techglider.in/post/2008/09/08/going-away-from-home/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2008 17:24:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://techglider.in/post/2008/09/08/going-away-from-home/</guid><description>Though not that far away, but it&amp;rsquo;s finally here. I will be living in some other place for the first time ever in my life. I want to admit, if I had not dropped the year, this may have happened more than a month ago (moving into hostel of some great college, I would have taken admission into).
So, what has happened is that due to LARGE commuting time for attending classes at FIITJEE (5 hours commute time for a 4 hour session), I have been forced to take up a room at Delhi and reside there.</description></item></channel></rss>
