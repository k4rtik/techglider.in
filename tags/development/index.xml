Since, (re-)learning a language requires both reading and writing code, I decided to work through some exercises on Exercism.
For C++, Exercism encourages a test-driven approach to solving problems and requires some tooling support (CMake) to focus on solving the problem instead of wasting time on setting up a build system for each exercise.</description></item><item><title>The Story of the TechGlider</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2011/03/26/the-story-of-the-techglider/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2011 05:41:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2011/03/26/the-story-of-the-techglider/</guid><description>Hi all, In this post I will be sharing some interesting points that fell along during realization of my idea of the TechGlider.First of all I am sharing some initial hand-drawn logos for the site. These were shared with my friend Arvis on June 28, 2009 for his comments.
The following was the outcome of earlier designs on July 5, 2009:
The following is a screenshot of StudenTech.</description></item><item><title>...and, we're back!</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2011/03/13/and-we-are-back/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2011 07:43:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2011/03/13/and-we-are-back/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been so long - missing the TechGlider - my dream, my hard work of over 2 years was gone. Started in July 2008, gone in July 2010. :(
The reason of this long absence: I lost the ownership of the domain techglider.com - partly because of my own carelessness, and partly because of my webhost Four &amp;lsquo;S&amp;rsquo; Tech&amp;rsquo;s troubles. In the process, I did learn a few interesting things like the concept of drop catching, how the companies like GoDaddy make so much money; and more importantly how not to lose my domain again.</description></item><item><title>A Simple Tic Tac Toe Game in C</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/11/12/a-simple-tic-tac-toe-game-in-c/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2009 13:24:53 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/11/12/a-simple-tic-tac-toe-game-in-c/</guid><description>Tic Tac Toe (T3), a two-player game developed in C/C++ in 2006-2007
For the school project in C++ in standard 11, I chose to make a game. Although the game doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature AI, it demonstrates the graphics and sound capabilities of C/C++ with Turbo C++ compiler.
Here is the link to the code (I can&amp;rsquo;t support it any more, so please don&amp;rsquo;t ask if you are unable to run it.):</description></item><item><title>TechGlider logo, finally designed</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/09/30/techglider-logo-finally-designed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2008 04:48:54 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/09/30/techglider-logo-finally-designed/</guid><description>I am happy :-) to inform all of you that I have finally designed a logo for the TechGlider:
Although I am not that satisfied with the logo, but I think it will do for the time being. Any suggestions for improvement of the logo are welcome.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish the development of TechGlider this week (designing a logo really takes too much of time ;-)</description></item><item><title>Mainstream development of TechGlider in full flow</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/09/23/mainstream-development-of-techglider-in-full-flow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2008 00:31:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/09/23/mainstream-development-of-techglider-in-full-flow/</guid><description>And, I came back earlier by a week from the schedule.
I am happy to announce that the start of the next week (hopefully) will see the rise of TechGlider in its full avatar; fully loaded with most of stuff I have to offer.
I have got certain idea of what is going to be the logo for the TechGlider and will be designing it on paper in this week.

It currently doesn&amp;rsquo;t support IE7 but that feature is in development beta. Find more info here: http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page
Update (Jun 23, 2011):
IEs4Linux now also supports IE7, IE8 and IE9 in beta.

I just tried to this yesterday on my N72 and want to tell you that it&amp;rsquo;s a great fun to do and a finer way to cut time we waste in commuting (than listening to music or playing games on our mobile).
Of course you need to know programming in order to utilize your phone in this manner.</description></item><item><title>Recommended Addons for Mozilla Firefox</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/17/recommended-addons-for-mozilla-firefox/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2008 07:28:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/17/recommended-addons-for-mozilla-firefox/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of recommended addons for our favorite Mozilla Firefox web browser: (But first upgrade to latest version of Firefox if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done it yet:http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ 8-)
