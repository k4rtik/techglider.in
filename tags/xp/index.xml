Now, I feel better that I gave it up in just 4 days of use and got rid of shame (read about it here) I was feeling that I installed XP again. I now have 2 variants of linux viz. Ubuntu 8.</description></item><item><title>TechGlider logo, finally designed</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/09/30/techglider-logo-finally-designed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2008 04:48:54 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/09/30/techglider-logo-finally-designed/</guid><description>I am happy :-) to inform all of you that I have finally designed a logo for the TechGlider:
Although I am not that satisfied with the logo, but I think it will do for the time being. Any suggestions for improvement of the logo are welcome.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish the development of TechGlider this week (designing a logo really takes too much of time ;-)</description></item></channel></rss>
