All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it&amp;rsquo;s just not that good. It&amp;rsquo;s trying to be good, it has potential, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer.</description></item><item><title>Review of Around India in 80 Trains</title><link>techglider.in/post/2015/05/03/review-of-around-india-in-80-trains/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2015 18:27:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2015/05/03/review-of-around-india-in-80-trains/</guid><description>Around India in 80 Trains by Monisha Rajesh
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
Got my hands on this book about two years ago when Amazon.in was launched and they were giving away some free Kindle books. Started reading it only when the Goodreads Indian Readers group picked this book as their April 2015 read.
Review This was the first time I read a travelogue and cannot say if I like the genre.</description></item><item><title>Review of No Place to Hide by Glenn Greenwald</title><link>techglider.in/post/2015/04/12/review-of-no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2015 12:37:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/post/2015/04/12/review-of-no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald/</guid><description>No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA and the Surveillance State by Glenn Greenwald
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
I had bought this book right away after reading the following tweet from a concerned friend:
It took me another 5 months to actually start reading the book.
Review First two chapters read like a Dan Brown thriller except that you constantly keep reminding yourself that this is not fiction and events leading to the Snowden revelations actually happened this way.</description></item><item><title>Learn</title><link>techglider.in/quote/2015/03/05/live-as-if-you-were-to-die-tomorrow-learn/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2015 07:13:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/quote/2015/03/05/live-as-if-you-were-to-die-tomorrow-learn/</guid><description>Live as if you were to die tomorrow.

I commit to taking full responsibility for the circumstances of my life, and my physical, emotional, mental and spiritual wellbeing. I commit to support others to take full responsibility for their lives.
I commit to blaming others and myself for what is wrong in the world.

My rating: 4 of 5 stars
Ended up reading a Hindi book after many years, &amp;lsquo;कथेतर&amp;rsquo; (non-fiction, new word learnt!) on that.
Little Background I haven&amp;rsquo;t followed Kejriwal&amp;rsquo;s or Anna&amp;rsquo;s movement from the beginning. I first gave serious attention when AAP managed to win a substantial number of seats in Delhi last December. Since then, I have come to admire Kejriwal&amp;rsquo;s clarity of thought, his ideas and his mission, all of which can be ascertained in any of his recent interviews or QA&amp;rsquo;s with audience where neither the interviewer nor the public leave any stone unturned to grill him.</description></item><item><title>You literally ought to be asking yourself all...</title><link>techglider.in/quote/2013/11/13/you-literally-ought-to-be-asking-yourself-all/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2013 15:48:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>techglider.in/quote/2013/11/13/you-literally-ought-to-be-asking-yourself-all/</guid><description>You literally ought to be asking yourself all of the time - what&amp;rsquo;s the most important thing I could be working on in the world right now; and if you are not working on that, why aren&amp;rsquo;t you?

Access to Computers - and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-on Imperative.
