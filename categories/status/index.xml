Perhaps Randy was wrong. I held this view for a very long time; but time has taken such a turn in last few months that I am only left wondering what Randy exactly meant by enough time.</description></item><item><title>Done messing up enough with the looks of...</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2011/03/13/done-messing-up-enough-with-the-looks-of/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2011 17:33:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2011/03/13/done-messing-up-enough-with-the-looks-of/</guid><description>Done messing up enough with the looks of my old blog for the day. Have exams this week and haven&amp;rsquo;t studied a thing. Need to take a week&amp;rsquo;s break from the net. ;)
On another note: I have restored my website: TechGlider.in during this Ragam. Do take a look at &amp;hellip;and, we&amp;rsquo;re back!.</description></item><item><title>And I successfully pulled out two consecutive all...</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2011/03/06/and-i-successfully-pulled-out-two-consecutive-all/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2011 00:22:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2011/03/06/and-i-successfully-pulled-out-two-consecutive-all/</guid><description>And I successfully pulled out two consecutive all-nighters - a first time in my life! For the record: my first all nighter in college was just in last sem (during which Jaseem had to kick me 2-3 times to keep me awake).
And these two were spent properly working on something I love and without facing any loss in productivity during the day. Congrats to myself!</description></item><item><title>Wow Just noticed my blog reached over a...</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2011/02/25/wow-just-noticed-my-blog-reached-over-a/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2011 10:30:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2011/02/25/wow-just-noticed-my-blog-reached-over-a/</guid><description>Wow!

Dijkstra (transcript availabe on that link). This was suggested by Subhashree mam in our first lecture of Discrete Computational Structures course with her. An interesting read about Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s life and history of the establishment of computing science as a discipline.</description></item><item><title>Discovered today the only two subjects I...</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2011/01/20/discovered-today-the-only-two-subjects-i/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2011 15:07:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2011/01/20/discovered-today-the-only-two-subjects-i/</guid><description>Discovered today the only two subjects I am really liking in my 4th sem of BTech:
Data Structures and Algorithms - no attendance, low strength, more discussion possible in Sudeep Sir&amp;rsquo;s class Computer Organization - I think I was always more inclined towards hardware and internals of computer system, assembly language programming comes as a bonus part with this course</description></item><item><title>Just installed QtSpim - the latest versi...</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2011/01/14/just-installed-qtspim-the-latest-versi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2011 04:34:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2011/01/14/just-installed-qtspim-the-latest-versi/</guid><description>Just installed QtSpim - the latest version of SPIM MIPS Simulator, hope to do start with some assembly coding soon.</description></item><item><title>Just discovered accidentally - In GMail ...</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2010/12/28/just-discovered-accidentally-in-gmail/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2010 06:43:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2010/12/28/just-discovered-accidentally-in-gmail/</guid><description>Just discovered accidentally - In GMail chat, if you surround text with 2 underscores or 2 stars, they show up as italicized and bold text respectively in the chat. For example: _hello_ gets converted to hello and *world* to world.

When you are pissed off at somebody, and you&amp;rsquo;re angry at them, you just haven&amp;rsquo;t given them enough time. Just give them a little more time — and they&amp;rsquo;ll almost always impress you.</description></item><item><title>Here is a video about the features of th...</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2010/12/20/wpvideo-yynw9isj/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2010 08:06:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/status/2010/12/20/wpvideo-yynw9isj/</guid><description>Here is a video about the features of the theme I am using:

And it was the last one ever. I am so grateful to Praveen because of whom I made up my mind to attend it. I badly needed a change in my thinking process which this foss.in has succeeded in bringing. This new blog is one step of the impact of the change.</description></item></channel></rss>
