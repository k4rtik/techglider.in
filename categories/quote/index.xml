Learn as if you were to live forever.
&amp;mdash;Mahatma Gandhi, Goodreads citation (did not find any authoritative source of this quote)
This used to be my motto for a long time before college, cannot recall when this disappeared from my active conscience. Caught my eye when Prof. Adam Porter quoted this in the announcement email for week 7 of his Coursera class on Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems.</description></item><item><title>15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2014/11/30/15-commitments-of-conscious-leadership/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2014 12:37:31 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2014/11/30/15-commitments-of-conscious-leadership/</guid><description>Read as &amp;lsquo;commitment&amp;rsquo; and then a &amp;lsquo;counter-commitment&amp;rsquo; for each point.
I commit to taking full responsibility for the circumstances of my life, and my physical, emotional, mental and spiritual wellbeing. I commit to support others to take full responsibility for their lives.
I commit to blaming others and myself for what is wrong in the world. I commit to being a victim, villain, or a hero and taking more or less than 100% responsibility.</description></item><item><title>UNIX is basically a simple operating system but...</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2011/10/13/unix-is-basically-a-simple-operating-system-but/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2011 08:36:16 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2011/10/13/unix-is-basically-a-simple-operating-system-but/</guid><description>UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity.

The code itself is unimportant; the project is only as useful as people actually find it.

Access to Computers - and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-on Imperative. All information should be free. Mistrust authority - promote decentralization. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race,or position. You can create art and beauty on a computer.</description></item><item><title>The Hacker Attitude</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2011/03/10/the-hacker-attitude/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2011 09:03:29 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/quote/2011/03/10/the-hacker-attitude/</guid><description>The Hacker Attitude:

From next class on, I will only respond to your questions. This course has plenty of readings. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have questions, it is either because you have not done your reading, or you are too stupid to be in this course.
