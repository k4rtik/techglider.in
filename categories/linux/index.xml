#!/bin/bash baseurl=&amp;#34;http://www.archive.org/download/MIT_Structure_of_Computer_Programs_1986/lec&amp;#34; urlend=&amp;#34;b_512kb.mp4&amp;#34; log=&amp;#34;log_b&amp;#34; for i in {1..7} do nohup wget -c &amp;#34;${baseurl}$i${urlend}&amp;#34; &amp;gt; &amp;#34;${log}$i&amp;#34; &amp;amp; done It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really do much, just put the baseurl and urlend properly which should be common for similar links and run a for loop.
Sharing so that it may come handy to some others in similar needs.</description></item><item><title>Simple script to install essential packages in Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid 64-bit</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2010/05/05/simple-script-to-install-essential-packages-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-64-bit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2010 07:16:11 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2010/05/05/simple-script-to-install-essential-packages-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-64-bit/</guid><description>Please note that this script has been tested only with a lucid 64-bit installation.

First of all, let me talk about the Lecture Series at Tathva &amp;lsquo;09.

Me being Ubuntu crazy, just started exploring it after downloading it. I setup my 8 GB Corsair Flash Voyager as a bootable Ubuntu 9.10 drive using USB Startup Disk Creator available in Jaunty.
Booting into the live system was similar as before except for the color and design of the Ubuntu logo on bootup has changed.</description></item><item><title>Wish I was at Shaastra 2009 HackFest</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/10/03/wish-i-was-at-shaastra-2009-hackfest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2009 16:37:42 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/10/03/wish-i-was-at-shaastra-2009-hackfest/</guid><description>Was just reading my twitter timeline when my eyes dropped on this tweet by Atul Chitnis:

I am back. I am feeling very glad to write after this long period of 3 months.
First of all I would like to tell you about a surprise I got today. I was just checking out the stats of techglider.in to see what are the pages that are popular and being most viewed.

I am finally finished with moving the TGB to WordPress. WordPress offers a plethora of plugins to customize one&amp;rsquo;s blog and I am trying to choose what are those that I need for the TGB. As pointed out in my last post, this change hasn&amp;rsquo;t been easy. I almost lost all of my previous posts for there was no efficient way to import the posts from my b2evolution installation to WordPress, so I had to do it manually and took a whole day for that (these type of repetitive works are really a pain in the neck for me).</description></item><item><title>Back to linux and switching to WordPress...</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/10/05/back-to-linux-and-switching-to-wordpress/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2008 12:36:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/10/05/back-to-linux-and-switching-to-wordpress/</guid><description>I am glad to tell you that I have got rid of windows XP (again!) after muddling my head for 2 days trying to make it stable on my system.

I ask them to differentiate between a hacker and a cracker first and specify what do they actually want to become. If the answer is a hacker, I need to direct them to this page (perhaps the best page on the net for a guide to becoming a hacker): http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html
For crackers-to-be I don&amp;rsquo;t have very-healthy feelings and ask them to correct their mindsets.</description></item><item><title>TechGlider logo, finally designed</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/09/30/techglider-logo-finally-designed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2008 04:48:54 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/09/30/techglider-logo-finally-designed/</guid><description>I am happy :-) to inform all of you that I have finally designed a logo for the TechGlider:

The best way, if you have unlimited internet (broadband) access, is to download the ISO image (usually 700 MB in size) from the website of the particular linux distribution and burn it on to a CD or DVD (in case of a DVD image) to install linux. e.g. visit http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download to choose and download the particular version of Ubuntu for your requirement.</description></item><item><title>My entry into the open world of linux</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/03/my-entry-into-the-open-world-of-linux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2008 00:31:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/03/my-entry-into-the-open-world-of-linux/</guid><description>July 30, 2008, the day I decided to completely scrap off Windows XP and switched to linux as my only operating system.
