This decision comes at a time when I have realized it&amp;rsquo;s no longer a good idea to build a community like this on phpBB, with the advent of platforms like facebook and twitter (and Google+ more recently) and their penetrations in our lives.</description></item><item><title>...and, we're back!</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2011/03/13/and-we-are-back/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2011 07:43:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2011/03/13/and-we-are-back/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been so long - missing the TechGlider - my dream, my hard work of over 2 years was gone. Started in July 2008, gone in July 2010. :(
The reason of this long absence: I lost the ownership of the domain techglider.com - partly because of my own carelessness, and partly because of my webhost Four &amp;lsquo;S&amp;rsquo; Tech&amp;rsquo;s troubles. In the process, I did learn a few interesting things like the concept of drop catching, how the companies like GoDaddy make so much money; and more importantly how not to lose my domain again.</description></item><item><title>My Airtel Woes</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2010/04/03/my-airtel-woes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2010 18:29:11 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2010/04/03/my-airtel-woes/</guid><description>I had bought a new Airtel SIM on Feb 8, just after FOSSMeet was over.

The main reason has been some or other problem with my website&amp;rsquo;s hosting server until it was shifted to another one in early Feb. But after this happened it&amp;rsquo;s some strange problem in the campus network that my website is only accessible at certain unexpected times as now. While writing this I am not sure, I will be able to publish this post or not, as the site seems accessible at completely random times and duration.</description></item><item><title>Adventure on our first visit to an airport</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2010/03/09/adventure-on-our-first-visit-to-an-airport/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2010 13:09:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2010/03/09/adventure-on-our-first-visit-to-an-airport/</guid><description>On Friday, I along with my friend Amit (aka Pandey) went to the Kozhikode airport to receive the guest Mr. Aditya Sengupta of FOSSEE, IIT Bombay.

We reached 15 minutes earlier than the scheduled time of arrival and found that the flight was delayed by 20 minutes.</description></item><item><title>Testing GScribble</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2010/02/26/testing-gscribble/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2010 18:10:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2010/02/26/testing-gscribble/</guid><description>Posting a blog post using a desktop client GScribble.

After spending more than 4 months here at NIT Calicut, I am finally going back home.
This period starting from AIEEE 2009 counseling in July has been an amazing roller coaster ride for me. Many wonderful things happened with me. I got admission to a college whose image I had always seen in my dreams. That too in the same branch, i.e. Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering, except for which I knew I could never excel in any other engineering branch.</description></item><item><title>Tathva and the Seniors - Part 1</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/11/20/tathva-and-the-seniors-part-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2009 17:55:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/11/20/tathva-and-the-seniors-part-1/</guid><description>OK, I agree, it&amp;rsquo;s been too late to post about Tathva.

First of all, let me talk about the Lecture Series at Tathva &amp;lsquo;09.

Finally, the change is here.
The main reason why I changed the name of the blog is simple. &amp;lsquo;The TechGlider Blog&amp;rsquo; sounds like the official blog of my site - TechGlider.com which, in its actuality, is not that. This is my blog, Kartik&amp;rsquo;s. So, the name Kartik Scribbles&amp;hellip;
More personalized, more sensible, more fun, more readable.</description></item><item><title>A Brief Overview of Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/10/30/a-brief-overview-of-ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2009 17:06:05 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/10/30/a-brief-overview-of-ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala/</guid><description>Just got my hands on to latest version of Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala around 5 hours ago.

Booting into the live system was similar as before except for the color and design of the Ubuntu logo on bootup has changed.</description></item><item><title>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam's visit to NIT Calicut</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/10/15/dr-apj-abdul-kalams-visit-to-nit-calicut/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2009 16:29:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2009/10/15/dr-apj-abdul-kalams-visit-to-nit-calicut/</guid><description>It was this day, that I was waiting for almost a month now.

First of all I would like to tell you about a surprise I got today. I was just checking out the stats of techglider.in to see what are the pages that are popular and being most viewed.

A lot has happened in between - that includes my leaving the room at Kalu Sarai (and start of the &amp;ldquo;then usual&amp;rdquo; up-downs from home to IIT Gate for classes); a lot of AITS tests which went bad as compared to my standards, leaving me bewildered at my scores; and some blows on my face that got me right on track.</description></item><item><title>I have found Happiness</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/12/09/i-have-found-happiness/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2008 16:27:07 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/12/09/i-have-found-happiness/</guid><description>It was this time that I spent a whole 8 days continuously at Kalu Sarai, not coming back to my home for the weekend.

And I feel happy about it. 11 posts in a month; it may seem too less to some of you, but, for me: I suppose I have been keeping up to my goal of writing regularly (and improving by the day :-) ).
I know I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to fulfill certain promises I made on the blog viz: guide to installing Ubuntu and unveiling the main TechGlider site.</description></item><item><title>FOSS and LAMP Workshop at ABES by ILUG-D</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/27/foss-and-lamp-workshop-at-abes-by-ilug-d/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2008 16:15:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/27/foss-and-lamp-workshop-at-abes-by-ilug-d/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 10 days since I last posted &amp;lsquo;cause I was (and am) following a very busy schedule.
A lot happened in these days. The most prominent event among many was the LAMP workshop by the India Linux Users&amp;rsquo; Group, Delhi held on August 23, 2008 at ABES Engineering College.
I was trying to get a fully working linux distro installed on my PC since I first assembled my PC back in December 2006.</description></item><item><title>iPhone 3G</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/23/iphone-3g/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2008 15:23:35 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/23/iphone-3g/</guid><description>As you may be knowing, Apple&amp;rsquo;s iPhone 3G has been launched just yesterday (Aug 22, 2008) at 00:00 hours by Airtel and Vodafone in India.

I remember those days when Gmail was in beta (although it&amp;rsquo;s still in beta as the Gmail logo says) and signup for a Gmail account was only by invitation. It was like a privilege to have a Gmail account B). Then, came an invitation from my cousin and I became a proud owner of my Gmail account.
Gmail gave me a lot of things I always desired from using the e-mail:</description></item><item><title>The TechGlider Forums are now active.</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/14/the-techglider-forums-are-now-active/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2008 00:31:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/14/the-techglider-forums-are-now-active/</guid><description>I am glad to inform you that finally the The TechGlider Forums have been activated on techglider.in. :-)

Now, after a successful transition from the proprietary to the open source, I am all happy and a lot more secure and satisfied :-), for the world of linux provides complete relief from the hassles of spyware, viruses and usual breakdowns of windows.
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know about linux, it is an operating system platform which is free and open (in the sense that you can see its code, modify it, distribute it and do a lot more).</description></item><item><title>All about TechGlider</title><link>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/01/all-about-techglider/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2008 02:12:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://k4rtik.github.io/techglider.in/post/2008/08/01/all-about-techglider/</guid><description>So, I am back. (That was a hard and very tiring day, yesterday, so couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep up to my promise of writing this post yesternight, :-( apologies)
TechGlider.com as its name suggests would take you gliding into the world of tech. The main focus would be on free and open source software but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I won&amp;rsquo;t focus on Windows or computer hardware or mobile phones for that matter. In short there would be stuff related to all things tech.</description></item></channel></rss>
